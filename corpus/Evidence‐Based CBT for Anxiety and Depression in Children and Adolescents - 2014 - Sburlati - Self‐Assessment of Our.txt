Part I Generic Therapeutic Competencies 3 Self-Assessment of Our Competence as Therapists Elizabeth S. Sburlati and James Bennett-Levy Introduction The gold standard for ensuring therapists have an acceptable and sustainable level of competence is generally achieved through objective measurement of a therapist’s competency by an experienced assessor, clinical supervision, continued targeted professional development, and positive outcomes with clients. However, in routine clinical practice, the most usual and most readily available method of quality control on a daily basis is self-assessment. Research has shown that therapists are often inaccurate in their estimations of their level of competence. Less competent therapists have been reported to overrate their level of competence when their own ratings were compared to ratings made by objective observers (Brosan, Reynolds, and Moore 2008). One of the reasons, it is suggested, is that less competent therapists often “don’t know what they don’t know” (Bennett-Levy and Beedie 2007; McManus, Rakovshik, Kennerley, Fennell, and Westbrook 2012, p. 301). On rare occasions it has been found that more competent therapists underestimate their abilities by comparison with supervisor ratings (McManus et al. 2012). Generally, however, therapists tend to have an overly positive view of their own abilities (Walfish, McAlister, O’Donnell, and Lambert 2012), which may com.promise the standard of practice among the therapist workforce (Brosan et al. 2008). Since research shows problems with therapists’ self-assessment, the purpose of this chapter is to assist with improving self-assessment, both in general and in the specific area of the treatment of child and adolescent anxiety and depressive disorders. In order to do this, the chapter includes four sections, which cover (i) suggested methods for competent self-assessment of therapeutic knowledge and skills; (ii) self-assessment in relation to working with anxiety and depressive disorders; (iii) self-assessment in Evidence-Based CBT for Anxiety and Depression in Children and Adolescents: A Competencies-Based Approach, First Edition.

While in this chapter we suggest some ways to assist therapists in assessing themselves, it is important to note that far more research is required in this area. Self-assessment is probably best used in combination with other methods of therapist competence assessment, such as objective competence assessment, client process and outcome data, 360-degree evaluations, pen-and-paper tests, and oral examinations (Kaslow et al. 2009). Key Features of Self-Assessment and Professional Development Competencies Definition of self-assessment Self-assessment of competence is the practice of validly assessing one’s professional competencies in an area of practice, with the purpose of determining competency strengths and weaknesses (Kaslow et al. 2007; Kaslow et al. 2009). Following self- assessment, therapists should identify their competency limitations, make plans to improve these competencies by engaging in appropriate professional development study, supervision/consultation, and deliberate practice (Ericsson, 2009), and mon.itor progress toward their competency goals (Belar et al. 2001; Caverzagie, Shea, and Kogan 2008; Kaslow et al. 2007; Kaslow et al. 2009). Methods of self-assessment We recommend the following methods of self-assessment: measurement of client outcomes and process; use of a guiding model of therapist competencies; use of valid and reliable assessment tools; active review and reflection on audio or video recording of therapy sessions; engagement in reflective practice; and active participation in clinical supervision and professional development, so as to increase one’s knowledge and refine self-assessment skills. These six methods are described below. Measurement of client outcomes and process A useful metric of therapist performance is whether clients are improving in line with expectations, or whether they are failing to improve. Research shows that ther.apists tend to be poor judges of client progress and outcomes and have an overly optimistic perspective and a biased appraisal of their own skill level (Newnham and Page 2010; Walfish et al. 2012). These biases suggest the need for accurate feedback on client progress. The adult psychotherapy literature indicates that the best way to judge client progress accurately is to measure outcomes on a routine basis (e.g., every session) and compare the results against population benchmarks and expected outcomes (Lambert 2010). An additional refinement is to get direct feedback from clients about the process of therapy: Are the client’s needs (therapeutic bond, tasks, and goals) being adequately met? Routine monitoring of the client’s experience of therapy, with a particular emphasis on elements with which the client is dissatisfied, has been shown to enhance therapy outcomes (Lambert 2010). The conclusion from the adult psychotherapy literature is that the assessment of client outcomes and therapeutic process provides an important foundation for making both positive adjustments to the therapeutic intervention (where these are necessary) and accurate self-assessment. In order to assess the therapeutic process and its out.comes, clinicians working with children and adolescents can use a range of available measures. Chapter 7 provides information on a number of evidence-based measures for assessing anxiety and depression that allow for an evaluation of client outcomes in terms of return to nonclinical range. Chapter 6 provides information on process-oriented measures that can be used to identify whether changes may be needed in the therapeutic process in order to enhance the likelihood of positive gains. Unlike the adult literature, however, the child and adolescent literature does not yet have client outcome benchmarks against which a therapist can compare his or her client’s progress during therapy. In consequence, a therapist can only determine whether all his or her clients’ outcome scores are improving or not, but cannot deter.mine whether the degree of improvement of an individual client is at the expected level during therapy. In the absence of appropriate benchmarks, data concerning the outcomes of a number of clients treated by a therapist could be compared with the expected outcomes that are based on meta-analyses. In anxiety disorders, for all clients who begin treatment, the response rate expected immediately after treatment would be about 59 percent – assuming that, if there are drop-outs, these did not improve (James, James, Cowdrey, Soler, and Choke 2013). Comparisons for depres.sion are only available on the basis of effect sizes; however, response rates for the larger treatment trials would indicate an expected response of between 43 and 65 percent at the 12–18 week mark (March et al. 2007). Although this is a crude comparison, it will provide useful evidence for a therapist’s self-reflection, until such time as research yields appropriate benchmarks for children and adolescents. Having a model of therapist competencies as a guide Without clear competency guidelines, therapists are unlikely to have a good under.standing of the competencies required to implement a particular therapy with a given population. Further, the evidence suggests that, when left to their own devices, ther.apists prefer to focus on self-assessing and improving conceptual knowledge and technical skills rather than interpersonal skills (Niemi and Tiuraniemi 2010). One way of ensuring that therapists are aware of the depth and breadth of the required competencies is to develop therapist competencies guidelines that list and describe in detail the competencies required when one is using a particular therapeutic orientation with a specific population. For example, there are guidelines in the form of therapist competencies models for treating anxiety and depression using CBT in adults (Roth and Pilling 2008) and in children and adolescents (Sburlati, Schniering, Lyneham, and Rapee 2011). Such models should be made readily available for those therapists who are attempting to learn the competencies required for a given therapy and population. Use of reliable, valid, objectively rated assessment tools Self-assessment practices tend to be non-standardized. One way to make self- assessment more standardized would be to use reliable and valid therapist competence assessment tools. This has been done in a number of research trials (e.g., Bennett-Levy and Beedie 2007; McManus et al. 2012). These assessment tools include a number of items that correspond to necessary competencies in a given area of prac.tice, and also a Likert scale of competency-related anchor points (e.g., incompetent, novice, advanced beginner, competent, proficient, expert) for each item (see Blackburn, James, Milne, and Reichelt 2001). An overall label is given for each competency item and more detailed descriptions are provided for how that compe.tency might look at each level of competence. While the vast majority of these tools are observer-rated – that is, a supervisor or some other observer rates the competence of a therapist, either in vivo or from a recording – the self-assessing therapist can record selected therapy sessions and simply change any reference to “the therapist” in the assessment measure to “I.” The validity of therapist self-assessment ratings might be increased when these ratings are made in conjunction with observer ratings on the same therapy sessions (Bennett-Levy and Beedie 2007). Two examples of observer-rated CBT competency measures that have been psycho-metrically validated are the following: 1. the Cognitive Therapy Scale (Vallis, Shaw, and Dobson 1986; Young and Beck 1980); 2. the Cognitive Therapy Scale – Revised (Blackburn, James, Milne, Baker, et al. 2001; Blackburn, James, Milne, and Reichelt 2001). A problem is that the above competency tools are measures of CBT in treating adults. Measures of competencies in treating children and adolescents with anxiety and depressive disorders are required. A measure based on the Sburlati and colleagues (2011) model is currently under development. Audio or video recording of therapy sessions Neither self-assessment nor objective assessment of competencies can take place in a systematic manner without sessions being audio- or video-recorded. Competency measures typically have a number of dimensions (e.g., conceptual, technical, interper.sonal), and assess specific skills (e.g., identification of negative automatic thoughts, case formulation). Recording one’s sessions enables therapists to review their microskills at a level of detail that is simply impossible when conducting a session in vivo (Brown, Moller, and Ramsey-Wade 2013). Reviewing a recorded session enables a therapist to assess him- or herself carefully at specific times in the therapy (e.g., when developing a shared conceptualization of the problem) and to determine how well this was enacted and whether it could have been carried out better (Brown et al. 2013). It is frequently the experience of thera.pists that, as they listen to a session recording, they pick up on details and nuances of the session of which they were quite unaware at the time. After a therapy session, therapists are sometimes left with a vague feeling that they “missed the point,” or that there was discomfort or a mini-rupture at some juncture in the session (Bennett-Levy and Thwaites, 2007, pp. 264–5). As we will describe in the next section, such experi.ences represent perfect opportunities to enhance our skills by engaging in reflective practice. Engaging in reflective practice Bennett-Levy and Thwaites (2007) and Bennett-Levy, Thwaites, Chaddock, and Davis (2009) propose that reflective practice is an integral part of self-assessment. Listening to a session recording and using a competency scale is one aspect of reflec.tive practice that requires an objective assessment of performance against defined criteria. This kind of objective, detached reflection, which these authors termed “gen.eral reflection” (Bennett-Levy and Thwaites 2007), is important in the assessment of one’s own skills, particularly conceptual and technical ones. However, equally important for therapists is another type of reflection: “self.reflection.” As defined by Bennett-Levy and colleagues (2009), the content of self-reflection is self-referenced to one’s thoughts, feelings, behaviors, or personal history. Self-reflection is particularly important where there is discomfort or a therapeutic rupture in the relationship. At such times we need to “go inside” and both feel our own feelings and reflect on the feelings and experiences of the client, in order to gauge them accurately and to determine whether any of our own precon.ceptions, emotions, or experiences from past events have been unwittingly triggered by the client. Self-reflection is more emotionally demanding and more personal than “general reflection” – but just as necessary for therapists who wish to assess themselves accurately, and particularly important for enhancing their interpersonal skills (Bennett-Levy and Thwaites, 2007). An “on the run” useful way to engage in reflective practice is spending 5–10 min.utes to reflect on a session immediately after it has finished and answering the follow.ing questions: “What did I do well?” “What could I have improved? How?” This is particularly useful once the therapist has internalized the required competencies and can mentally cross-check them against the actual performance. Actively participating in supervision and accessing professional development Supervision, or consultation, is now considered to be an integral part of training and professional development (e.g., Beidas, Edmunds, Marcus, and Kendall 2012; Rakovshik and McManus 2010). Engagement in supervision may be enhanced by recording one’s therapy sessions and giving the supervisor these recordings for review and feedback; by agreeing on a competence assessment method with the supervisor; by comparing observer-rated and self-rated competence results; and by analyzing the discrepancies between these assessments – as well as various strengths and weaknesses. Once areas of weakness are identified, a learning plan can be devel.oped, along with a method of tracking improvement over time; and the plan should highlight the learning needs and the professional development training methods to achieve them (Belar et al. 2001; Caverzagie, Shea, and Kogan 2008; Kaslow et al. 2007; Kaslow et al. 2009). Competence in Self-Assessment when Treating  Anxiety Disorders and Depression While the process of therapist self-assessment appears to be broadly similar for anxiety disorders and for depression, the therapist should be mindful that evidence-based treatment in anxiety disorders and in depression includes some different techniques. This means that the competencies or techniques on which therapists are assessing themselves when they treat anxiety will be slightly different from the ones they are assessing themselves on when they treat depression. For instance, in the CBT treatment of both anxiety disorders and depressive disorders, cognitive restructuring would likely be indicated for both. However, while exposure therapy would be indicated for anxiety, it would not usually be indicated for depression. On the other hand, pleasant events scheduling or behavioral activation might be suggested for depression, but not usually for anxiety. Given the high degree of comorbidity between anxiety disorders and depression (Angold, Costello and Erkanli, 1999), therapists must be aware of the need to combine, in their treatment planning, evidence-based techniques for treating anxiety with evidence-based techniques for treating depression. It follows from the example above that, on seeing a child with both anxiety and depression, the therapist ought to make use of cognitive restructuring applied to both anxiolytic and depressogenic thoughts and may utilize aspects of exposure to enable that client to engage in pleas.ant events scheduling or behavioral activation. This skill, which is related to treatment planning, is an additional competency for the therapist to assess him- or herself in (see Chapter 9 for more details about treatment planning for anxiety and depression). Competence in Self-Assessment of Skills when Treating Children and Adolescents While the process of self-assessment is likely the same for therapists treating children and for therapists treating adolescents, the strategies, techniques, and interpersonal skills that the therapist assesses him- or herself on when treating these different age groups can differ. As is highlighted throughout this book, there are important differ.ences in the therapeutic competencies required for treating anxiety and/or depression in different age groups. When working with children and adolescents, therapists need to understand how a child’s age and other characteristics of children impact on therapy (see Chapter 5), and be capable of making age-appropriate accommodations for therapy procedures (e.g., structure, pace, use of age-appropriate activities) and tech.niques (e.g., limiting cognitive requirements in cognitive restructuring) (Kingery et al. 2006; Ollendick and Hovey 2010; Sauter, Heyne, and Westenberg 2009; Sburlati et al. 2011). Unlike those engaged in the treatment of adults, therapists treating children and adolescents are required to develop and maintain a therapeutic alliance with both the client (the child or the adolescent) and the parent(s) (see Chapter 6 for a more detailed discussion). In addition, the therapist needs to be capable of judging the appropriate level of parental involvement in therapy on the basis of the child’s or the adolescent’s developmental level (Kingery et al. 2006; Sauter, Heyne, and Westenberg 2009). Therefore therapists of children and adolescents need the ability to develop and main.tain multiple alliances – which can be difficult when the aims of the client and those of their parents differ. As part of their self-reflection process, therapists may reflect on how their experi.ences as parents impact on their therapeutic alliances with parent and child and on how their own parenting beliefs, practices, and relationship with children may be impacting the therapeutic relationship. In addition, whether a therapist is a parent or not may influence the parent’s perception of that therapist’s competence. Hence the therapist’s handling of the question “Do you have children?” is worth reflecting on: it may have significant implications for building and maintaining the desired alliance. Common Obstacles to Self-Assessment and Professional Development Practice and Methods to Overcome Them There are many obstacles to a therapist assessing his or her competence in an effective way. Below we describe some common obstacles and methods to overcome them. Monitoring client progress and gaining client feedback Although weekly monitoring of progress and getting feedback from the client are associated with better outcomes (Lambert 2010; Newnham and Page 2010) – and, quite probably, with enhanced self-assessment – many therapists are reluctant to use these procedures. Therapists would do well to study the empirical literature on process and outcome monitoring and, if they are still reluctant, to ask themselves self-reflectively: What concerns (e.g., ideas about therapy or about myself as a therapist) are getting in the way of a regular monitoring of process and outcome with my clients? Having addressed these concerns, therapists who make a decision to change their practice should determine what measures would work best for their clients’ age group and population and how best to seek accurate feedback about process from clients who may be reluctant to articulate negative opinions. Recording therapy sessions As indicated earlier, one of the key methods for assessing one’s own competence is the use of recorded therapy sessions. However, both therapists and clients may show reluctance to being recorded – and for similar reasons: fear of negative evaluation. Therapists may be reluctant to expose their “mistakes” to supervisors. Self-reflective practice may be helpful to determine what thoughts and ideas are getting in the way. Clients may be apprehensive about how the recording may be used in the future, or they may fear negative evaluation from observers (this might be particularly true for self-conscious adolescents). In order to overcome client apprehension, the therapist could: 1. develop a system that will ensure the confidentiality of recordings (e.g., by keep.ing physical copies in a locked filing cabinet and digital copies in a password-protected environment, and by ensuring that only authorized individuals can obtain access to them); 2. generate an official information and consent form outlining the specific purpose and uses of the recording, as well as the procedure in place for maintaining confidentiality; 3. assure the client that the aim of the recording is to assess the therapist, not the client; 4. direct the recording device away from the client onto him- or herself, to diminish fear of negative evaluation from viewers; 5. offer the client a choice between audio only and video recording, as the former may be seen as less threatening. In addition to these modifications, the therapist may also offer to give the child or adolescent – and maybe the parent(s) if they are actively involved in therapy – a copy of the recorded session, so that they may listen to it again, if they wish. Adult clients are reported to find this beneficial, particularly as they do not recall everything said in a session (Shepherd, Salkovskis, and Morris 2009). Accessing supervision It can be difficult for therapists to obtain supervision from a clinical expert in their area of practice; this may be due to a lack of experts, geographical distance from them, and costs associated with obtaining expert consultation. Therefore therapists may not always be able to make use of supervision to assist with their self-assessment and professional development choices. One method of overcoming the geographical obstacle is the use of web conferencing (Abbass et al. 2011). This tool is advantageous given the increased availability of easy to use and affordable internet applications that allow face-to-face communication across the globe. Group supervision methods are also sometimes used (e.g., Abbass et al. 2011; Riva and Erickson Cornish 2008): these could reduce the cost associated with expert supervision. Accessing training Once the therapist has assessed his or her own level of competence and has identified the nature of the training required, a possible obstacle to obtaining this training is its inaccessibility due to geographical distance from face-to-face workshops (Weingardt, Villafranca, and Levin 2006). This is particularly true in countries with widely dispersed populations (e.g., Australia, USA). Recently some training programs have been made accessible online, with research to date demonstrating promising results (e.g., Bennett-Levy, Hawkins, Perry, Cromarty, and Mills 2012; Kobak, Craske, Rose, and Wolitsky-Taylor 2013). By having training programs online, therapists may be more likely to obtain the training that will help them to meet their self-assessed learning needs. However, research also suggests that, in order for training to be more effective, follow-up reflective practice (Bennett-Levy and Padesky 2014) and consul.tation (Beidas, Edmonds, Marcus and Kendall 2012) are prime requirements. Conclusion This chapter has discussed the importance of therapists’ self-assessment of their competence and professional development; methods for improving self-assessment; ways of assessing one’s own skills when one is treating child and adolescent anxiety and depressive disorders; and common obstacles to self-assessment and professional development. It is hoped that, by improving self-assessment and ensuring therapists receive effective training and supervision, individuals seeking assistance for psychological problems will receive a better standard of care. References Abbass, Allan, Stephen Arthey, Jason Elliott, Tim Fedak, Dion Nowoweiski, Jasmina Markovs.ki, and Sarah Nowoweiski. 2011. “Web-Conference Supervision for Advanced Psychother.apy Training: A Practical Guide.” Psychotherapy, 48: 109–18.
