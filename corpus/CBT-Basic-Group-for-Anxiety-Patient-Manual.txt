Each Monday and Tuesday is  the same topic, so you can come to whichever fits your    schedule best.  -You can attend these in any order you like. -Each session we will cover just some of these CBT  skills. If you have questions during the group, please ask!  It is also possible any confusion you have at the  beginning will clear up as you continue to attend    the sessions.  -This group is not meant to fix your anxiety completely.  We want to give you a chance to try out some of these  techniques and understand your anxiety better. When you  get done with this group you may want to continue with     group or individual CBT treatment here at U of M. What is Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy? Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a short-term, evidence-based treatment for many problems, including anxiety. It is based on the idea that thoughts (cognitions) and behaviors affect the way we feel. Feelings (emotions) Thoughts (cognitions)  Behaviors (actions) Weekly Group topics: Anxiety Vulnerability Management (week 1) Do you ever think you have more anxiety than other people? Find out why and learn how to use CBT skills to fight your anxiety over the long term. Relaxation (week 2) Just relax! What to do and when to try relaxation strategies to help make you feel less stress and tension in your daily life. Exposure and Desensitization (week 3) рAvoid avoidance:с how our behaviors can make anxiety worse, and the surprising way to get it to leave us alone! Cognitive Therapy Skills (week 4) Our thoughts matter! Learn ways our thoughts can change how we feel and influence what we do. Turn thoughts into your ally, instead of your enemy. We want to be sure that our treatment is effective! Evidence-based means that there is scientific evidence to show that something works.  CBT is an evidence-based treatment that has been studied and shown to be effective in hundreds of scientific experiments. While there is no 100% guarantee that CBT will work for you, it is likely that with practice and hard work you will receive benefit from these techniques.  How to use this manual This manual includes a lot of information on anxiety and CBTп more than we have time to cover in the group sessions, and perhaps more than you will have time to review on your own! You will get the most out of this group if you take notes during the group and then review the manual between sessions. Remember that different people get benefit from different CBT skills, so we expect that you will use the skills that work and let go of the rest. We hope that you will try each skill out to determine if it suits you. Refer to рAppendix IV: This is so much information! Where do I start?с to make your reading more efficient by starting with the information most pertinent to your particular problem. Finally, be sure to bring the manual back next week! iii. There is a great deal of scientific research on psychotherapy, and we know a lot about what can be helpful for people. We continue to learn more and more about how to use psychotherapy to help as many people as possible. However, because everyone is different, and our brains and lives are very complex, right now it is often hard to know exactly what it is that will help a particular person feel better.  On the next page, follow the path from the bottom of the page upward for some tips to make your рpath through psychotherapyс more helpful and rewarding.  See this as just one piece of the puzzle in your process of better understanding yourself and moving toward what you want in your life. Get all you can out of it and then make efforts to find out what other types of work could be helpful. For example, maybe you did a great deal of work on managing your depression with cognitive and behavioral skills. Now you believe that you want to improve your relationships to achieve more in that area of your life.  Manage barriers to showing up regularly to treatment and practicing skills: improvement depends primarily on follow-through and the amount of work you put into your therapy.  Address depression from different angles. There is no one рsilver bulletс that will change depression all by itself. Usually a combination treatment, or mixed approach is what works best to make depression better. This also means putting in some effort to understand the different ways to manage your depression.   Practice skills over, and over, and over. It usually takes time for changes in our behavior and thinking to lead to feeling better. Like learning an instrument, we are practicing new ways of doing things that will feel рclunkyс at first, and become more comfortable over time. Take small steps toward change each day. Try not to wait for рlight bulb moments,с рepiphanies,с or for something to take it all away instantly.  Expect ups and downs during the process. Think of it as р2 steps forward, 1 step back.с Try not to get too discouraged or give up when things seem to move backward or stagnate.  Make it about you: engage in your treatment because you want to improve your life, take responsibility for achieving you aims, and feeling better, not because others are telling you to do so. Remember that even if you are being pushed to engage in therapy by someone else, that relationship must be important enough for you to consider this option! Maintain an open mind about the possibility of change, while being realistic about how fast this change can happen. Especially at first, gauge success according to how you change your responses to stress, uncomfortable emotions, and body sensations, not whether or not these things exist or continue to occur. Focus on valued action, even more than just рfeeling better.с рCredibility:с Make sure the treatment in which you are engaging makes sense to you and seems to be addressing your problem. There are different paths to the same goal. If this type of therapy is not working for you, you are confused about what you are doing, or you have any other concerns, talk to your clinician right away. Clinicians are trained to have these discussions with their patients! Make sure your definition of the рproblemс is the same as the clinicians with whom you are working. Maybe they think it is рdepressionс and you think it is something else. Try to clarify this with your clinicians. Section One: Anxiety 101иииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииии.иииииииииииииииииии..1.1 Anxiety Isиииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииии1.2 Why does my body do this? иииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииии1.3 Anxiety рTriggersс ииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииии.иииииии..иииии1.4 Anxiety рFuelс иииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииии.ииииииии...ииии1.6 Anxiety 101 Summaryиииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииии.иииииии1.9 Section Two: Exposure and Desensitization иииииииииииииии.иииииииииииииииииииииииии..ииииии2.1 What is exposure? ииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииии.иииииии2.2 Should I do exposure? иииииииииииииииииииииииииии.ииииииииииииииииииииии...иии2.3 Desensitizationиииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииии..................................................................................................2.4 Exposure: Getting Startedииииииииииииииииииииииии.........................................................................................................2.6 The Exposure Formulaиииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииии.ииии.ииии.иииии2.8 Exposure Tipsииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииии...ииииииииииии..ииииии.иииии2.9 Exposure: Tracking Your Progress5ииииииииииииииииии...ииииииииииии..ииииии....ииии2.10 Exposure examples: рExternal Cue Exposureс иииииииии...иииииииииии..ииииии....ииии2.11 Exposure Examples: рInternal Cue Exposureс for Panic Disorderиииии..ииииии.ииии2.12 Questions about Exposureииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииии..ииииии.и....иии.ииии2.14 Exposure for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorderииииииииииииииии..ииии..ии.и....иии.ииии2.15 Barriers in Exposure Treatmentиииииииииииииииииииииииииииии..ииииии.и....и.ии.ииии2.16 The Freedom of Choice: Exposure in Daily Lifeииииииииииииии..ииииии.и....и.ии.ииии..2.17 Exposure and Desensitization Summaryиииииииииииииииииииии..иии..иииии.и....и.ии.ии2.18 Fear Hierarchy Homework Form (blank) иииииииииииии.иииииии..иии..иииии...и.и....и.ии2.19 Exposure Tracking Form (blank) иииииииииииииииииииииииииии..ииииии.ии.......иии.иии.2.20 Exposure Tracking Form for Hourly Exposure (blank) иииииии......иииииии.ии...........ии.ии.2.21 Section Three: Cognitive Therapy Skillsииииииииииииииииииииииииии..ииииииииии..ии.ии.......и.ии.иии3.1 What are Cognitive Therapy Skills? иииииииииииииии..иииииии...иииии..ии.ии.......и.ии.иии3.2 Negative Automatic Thoughtsиииииииииииииии..ииииииииииииииии...и..ии.ии.......и.ии.иии3.4 Identifying Negative Automatic Thoughtsиииииииииииииии..ииииииииии..ии.и..и.ии.иии3.6 Thought Cascade Worksheetиииииииииииииии.иииииииии..ииииииииии..ии.ии.......и.ии.иии3.7 Daily Thought Record Worksheetиииииииииииииии..иииииииииииииии..ии.ии.......и.ии.иии3.8 Cognitive Distortionsиииииииииииииии..ииииииииии..ии.ии.......и.ии.ииииииииииииииииии..3.9 Examples of Cognitive Distortionsиииииииииииииии..ииииииииииииии..ии.ии.......и.ии.иии3.10 Examining the Evidenceиииииииииииииии..ииииииииии..иииииииииииииии.ии.......и.ии.иии3.12 The Gambler: Predicting Ourselves Anxiousиииииииииииииии..иии...ии..ии.ии.......и.ии.иии3.13 Catastrophizing: рThat Would Be Horribleс иииииииииии..ииииииииии..ии.ии.......и.ии.иии3.14 Examining Thoughts, Written Methodиииииииииииииии..ии...ииииии..ии..ии.ии.......и.ии.иии3.16 Examining Thoughts Worksheetиииииииииииииииииии..ии..ииииииииии..ии.ии.......и.ии.иии3.17 рThe Only Thing We Have to Fear is Fear Itself:с How to work on                          negative thoughts about anxiety and panic attacksии..ии.ии..........и.ии.иии3.18 рDonуt worryис Cognitive Skills for Daily Worry and Generalized Anxiety.......и.иии.ии3.24 Common Thoughts about Anxiety and its Treatmentиииииииииии..ии..и.ии3.30 Cognitive Therapy Skills Summaryииииииииии..ииииииииииииииии..ии..и.и.ии.......и.ии.иии3.31 Table of Contents, con рWe experience moments absolutely free from worry. These brief respites are called panic.с ~Cullen Hightower This part of the group is meant to explore important information about the anxiety itself. The first step to managing anxiety is understanding it as well as we canп to рknow thine enemy,с so to speak. On the pages entitled  рAnxiety isис and рWhy does my body do this?с weуll talk about: -What the anxiety рalarmс really is: the рfight or flightс           responseя and what its common symptoms are -The difference between normal anxiety and рphobicс                                anxiety -What causes anxiety -Why our bodies do what they do when we are anxious -Why we canуt just рget rid ofс the anxiety In the section рAnxiety Triggers,с weуll go over the different things that can trigger anxiety and how the brain comes to believe these triggers are dangerous. In our final section, рAnxiety Fuel,с we learn about common ways that anxiety can get worse, and how our own thoughts and behaviors play a role in this process. Anxiety is a part of our bodiesу natural alarm system, the рfight or flightс response, which exists to protect us from danger. These natural body responses are not harmfulя but they are really uncomfortable! The most pure form of the рfight or flightс response is a panic attack, which involves a rush of anxiety symptoms, many of which are listed below, usually peaking in about 10 minutes. In these cases, the body is trying to tell us рsomething dangerous is happening right now!с Other forms of anxiety that are less acute but often just as debilitating, such as chronic worry, involve symptoms similar to the рfight or flightс symptoms of panic attacks. However, in these cases, it is as if the body is saying рsomething dangerous is going to happen sometime in the futureи so watch out!с The differences between the two are the intensity of the response and the context in which it is triggered. In this manual we will refer to all anxiety symptoms as being related to the рfight or flightс response. The most common anxiety symptoms are listed below. Try circling the ones that apply to you. Physical Symptoms -Rapid heartbeat -Sweating -Trouble breathing -Tightness in the chest, chest pain -Dizziness -Feeling: рThings arenуt realс -Feeling: рI donуt feel like myself.с -Tingling and numbness in fingers, toes,        and other extremities -Nausea, vomiting -Muscle tension -Low energy, exhaustion -Changes in body temperature -Shaking, jitters -Urgency to urinate or defecate -Changes in vision and other senses Cognitive (thinking) Symptoms -Worries -Negative thoughts about oneуs ability to        tolerate emotions or future stress -Negative predictions about future       events -Other common thoughts:       рI am going crazy!с       рI am going to have a heart attack!с       рI am going to faint.с -Trouble concentrating or keeping attention -Magical ideas, phrases or images such as рIf I do not wash my hands I will die or someone will be harmed.с -Preoccupation with body sensations or functions Behavioral Symptoms -Avoidance of anything that provokes          anxiety, including people, places,            situations, objects, animals,              thoughts, memories, body           feelings, etc. -Protective, рsafetyс behaviors -Aggression, verbal abuse, lashing out -Alcohol and/or drug use -Compulsive behaviors, such as       excessive checking or other           unreasonable or harmful rituals or           routines What causes anxiety? We know from scientific research that anxiety is caused by a combination of factors related to both рnatureс (genetics) and рnurtureс (experience). Check out page 82 for a more detailed explanation of the factors that can lead to anxiety. When рfight or flightс goes too far: рPhobicс anxiety Everyone experiences anxiety from time-to-time. We often get the question: рHow do I know if I have an anxiety disorder?с An anxiety disorder is diagnosed when someone experiences anxiety symptoms and these symptoms: -Interfere with a personуs life aims -Happen too often or with too much intensity, given the actual                                                        danger of a situation -Are not explained by other factors, such as a medical problem or                                                        substance abuse Some people experience significant anxiety and choose simply to live with it. It is up to you to decide if you can handle the anxiety on your own, or if treatment is necessary. Take home point: The symptoms of anxiety are the рfight or flightс response, and are normal, functional, and necessary for survival. They become a problem when they are too severe or happen too often, given the real amount of danger present, or if it interferes with the activities of life. Remember: Anxiety is uncomfortable, not dangerous! Why canуt I just get rid of my anxiety? Anxiety is as vital to our survival as hunger and thirst. Without our рfight or flightс response we would not be as aware of possible threats to our safety. We also might not take care of ourselves or prepare adequately for the future. And we probably wouldnуt enjoy a scary movie or a roller coaster! Anxiety is necessary to protect us and can even be fun at times. It isnуt in our best interests to get rid of it completely! We have evolved over millions of years to better protect ourselves. Our brains have learned to automatically signal danger when it is present or we perceive that we may be harmed in some way. Each symptom of anxiety has a specific evolutionary purpose, to help us рfightс or рflee.с Try to figure out how each symptom of anxiety is used by our bodies to protect us when we are in danger, by matching the evolutionary purpose with the anxiety symptoms. Some in the right-hand column may be used twice, and there may be multiple answers for some symptoms. Once you are done, you can see if you were rightя the answers are at the bottom of the page. Also, a more detailed diagram of the biology of the рfight or flightс response is in Appendix I, рThe Biology of Fight or Flight.с Anxiety Symptom 1. Rapid heartbeat_______ 2. Sweating_______ 3. Flushing in face_______ 4. Tightness in the chest, chest pain_______ 5. Feeling: рThings arenуt realс_______ 6. Feeling: рIуm not myselfс_______ 7. Tingling or numbness in        fingers and toes_______ 8. Nausea, vomiting_______ 9. Muscle tension, stiffness_______ 10. Low energy, exhaustion______ 11. Changes in body temperature_______ 12. Shaking, jitteriness______ 13. Urgency to urinate or defecate_______ 14. Hyperventilation or trouble breathing_____ 15. Dizziness, lightheadedness_____ 16. Worries_______ 17. Negative predictions about future events_______ 18. Trouble concentrating or keeping attention______ 19. Avoiding_______ 20. Fight or be aggressive_______ 21. Changes in vision, hearing, smell, taste_______ 22. Dry mouth______ Purpose A.

Decrease in salivation Did you knowи when our bodyуs рfight or flightс alarm is triggered, a domino effect of chemical changes and messages are sent to various parts of the brain and body, producing these symptoms. This process is programmed to last only about 10 minutes, unless it is triggered again. Answers: 1. B 2. K 3. B 4. A,D 5. L 6. L 7. L 8. I 9. A 10. C 11. L 12. A 13. I 14. D 15. L 16. E 17. G 18.

When this рradarс spots something that could be dangerous, it tells the brain to begin the рfight or flightс response, producing the uncomfortable feelings we get when we are anxious.  рOne thing leads to another:с how a trigger becomes connected with our рfight or flightс response When we perceive danger, whatever it is that could be dangerous (in this case, a spider) is remembered by the amygdala. The next time something reminds us of the spider, or we actually come into contact with one, our anxiety рalarmс goes off. Types of anxiety triggers and the Anxiety Disorder рDiagnosisс Nearly anything can be trained to trigger the рfight or flightс response. Psychiatrists, psychologists, psychiatric nurses, and clinical psychiatric social workers have tried to find ways to tell the difference between different types of anxiety triggers. Anxiety disorder diagnoses come out of this attempt. While a diagnosis is not a perfect way of describing a personуs experiences, it can help us to know what types of treatments may be effective. Different groups of triggers and the diagnoses most frequently associated with them are listed below. Some of these categories overlap, and it is possible for one person to have more than one diagnosis. Trigger  Diagnosis  Worries, predictions, and negative thoughts about the future  Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)  Social situations and people, such as social events and performances, along  Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia)  with fear of criticism from others  Fear of having a panic attack and fear of body feelings that remind one of  Panic Disorder  panic attacks  Places a panic attack has happened before or could happen  Agoraphobia  Places, situations, animals, objects, blood or injury, etc.  Specific Phobias  Disturbing intrusive thoughts, contamination, doubt and urge to check things,  Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)  etc.  Memories and things associated with a traumatic event  Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)  Scary event?? Anxiety?? Some people wonder if scary events caused their anxiety, or if their anxiety itself is what causes them to more readily see things as scary. We know from scientific research on anxiety that both are true. Events and stress in our lives can create more anxiety. For example, a passenger on a flight that barely escapes an serious accident may feel anxiety the next time they take a flight, especially if this was one of their first flying experiences. Flying may then become a new anxiety trigger. Conversely, someone that is already vulnerable to having anxiety (see page 82 for more on this) may experience normal turbulence on a flight as scary and then feel afraid to fly in the future.  What if I donуt know what triggers my anxiety? For the sake of treatment, it is important to learn to identify what it is that makes you anxious. For some people it is very clear; for others, anxiety seems to come from рout of nowhere.с To identify what makes you anxious, ask yourself the following questions: рWhen I feel scared or nervous, what is going on around me or what am I thinking about?с рAm I worried about having more anxiety in the future?с рAm I afraid of body sensations that remind me of intense anxiety attacks?с рDo I ever try to do more than I can handle or create unrealistic expectations for myself or others?с рAm I worried that I will not be able to cope if bad things happen in the future?с Anxiety рTriggersс take home points: Exercise My anxiety triggers are: The brain can learn to be afraid of almost anything, and some anxiety List here the objects, situations, events, or places  that tend to trigger your anxiety.

Anything that teaches the amygdala (the anxiety center of the brain) that something is dangerous. Remember our spider example? Letуs say that every time this man sees a spider he tries to avoid it by getting away. What does this teach him? That the spider is dangerous, of course! Each time he avoids the spider, his amygdala gets more feedback that the spider is dangerous. Next time he sees the spider, his anxiety рalarmс will be louder, or it may go off more quickly than before. The process by which the brain learns that something is more dangerous over time is called sensitization. It is also called reinforcement of the anxiety because the anxiety response gets stronger and stronger. Reinforcement can happen both in the short term (when the danger seems to be present) or in the long term, as we discuss below. Short-term reinforcement: the anxiety рsnowball effectс Have you ever worried about speaking in front of a group of people? Worries about performing well can lead to jitteriness, cracking voice, difficulty concentrating, and other рfight or flightс symptoms. Often the physical anxiety symptoms will then create more worry about the performance; this creates a рsnowball effect,с in which anxiety gets worse and worse, even to the point of panic. Worry about speech Anxiety рFuel,с continued Safety behaviors are often justified using рas long asс statements: Avoidance: рAs long as I avoid that, I will be safe.с Attacking others, acting on anger, etc.: рAs long as I use verbal or physical force to protect myself, I will have control.с Protective behaviors: рAs long as I have my water bottle with me, I am safe and will not have another panic attack.с Rituals (usually part of OCD, characterized by excessive, repetitive checking, washing, counting, asking for reassurance, etc.): рAs long as I knock four times when I have a scary thought, nothing bad will happen to my daughter.с Substance use (trying to рnumbс the anxiety): рAs long as I can have some alcohol, I will feel better.с Long-term reinforcement:  рSafety Behaviorsс and negative thoughts/beliefs As mentioned earlier, anxiety рfuelс is anything that teaches the anxiety center of the brain, the amygdala, that something is dangerous. Over the long term, the most common ways to do this involve negative thoughts and beliefs as well as protective actions called safety behaviors. While these behaviors seem to help the anxiety right now, they usually make it worse in the long run. Examples are listed below. Behaviors Thoughts Negative thoughts about:     -the future     -yourself      -other people     -the world Examples: рI am going to lose my job and end up homeless.с рI must have controlис рThat person thinks I am an idiot.с рIf I drive on the highway I will get into an accident.с рIf I keep having this thought it must be true.с Whether in the short run or over time, anxiety feelings, fearful thoughts, and protective, рsafetyс behaviors work together to keep our anxiety рfireс burning. Each feeds off the others, and any one of these can act as the рmatchс to get the fire started. In CBT, our goal is to work on these thoughts and behaviors to help extinguish the fire as much as possible.  Anxiety symptoms (рfight or flightс response) Fearful thoughts Safety behaviors Anxiety рFuel,с continued Anxiety рFuelс take home points: Some of our thoughts and behaviors, while they seem to help us, actually make anxiety worse.

They become a problem when they are too severe or happen too much given the real amount of danger present, or if it interferes with the activities of life. While having chronic anxiety over long periods of time puts stress on the body, it can be helpful to remember that anxiety itself is not dangerous; but it sure can be uncomfortable. Anxiety Triggers Here we learned that the brain can learn to be afraid of almost anything, and some anxiety рtriggersс are more common than others. Anxiety disorder diagnoses are organized based on what triggers the anxiety. We know that anxiety can be caused by scary events, and anxiety can also make one more likely to experience an event as scary. It is important to identify your anxiety рtriggers.с In most cases it is possible to figure them out yourself. Sometimes it is necessary to have the help of a mental health professional to do this. A few tips are on page 10. Why does my body do this? In this section we covered the ways that each рfight or flightс symptom functions to protect us in case we are in real danger. We also learned that when our bodyуs рfight or flightс alarm is triggered, a domino effect of chemical changes and messages are sent to various parts of the brain and body, producing these symptoms. This process is programmed to last only about 10 minutes, unless it is triggered again. Anxiety Fuel Some of our thoughts and behaviors, while they seem to help us, actually make anxiety worse. Safety behaviors, such as avoidance and protective behaviors, as well as negative thoughts, serve to reinforce anxiety in both the short- and long-term. It is important to understand how we make our anxiety worse, so that we can work to reverse this through treatment. A common question: What if it really is dangerous? Of course, we are not trying to ignore anxiety or feel calm if something really is dangerous. One of our goals in CBT is to learn what is dangerous and what is not, what we can control and what we canуt, and how to balance taking risks with keeping ourselves safe.  If you are here, it is likely that the cost of trying to keep yourself safe is outweighing the advantages. Weуll be exploring this more in some of our other modules. рDo one thing every day that scares you.с~Eleanor Roosevelt In this part of the group manual we will learn about exposure, one of the most powerful weapons to battle anxiety and a big part of CBT treatment. We spoke about sensitization in the section рAnxiety Fuel.с Now weуll talk about desensitization, which means we work to make our anxiety alarm less sensitive, so it doesnуt go off as often or as loudly.   In this section we will learn what exposure is, when and how to use it, and some important rules to follow to be sure we get the most out of treatment. Weуll also try to give you lots of examples so it makes sense to you; we want you to know what to do, but also how and why it works. In other words, we want you to be sold on exposure! Have you ever been afraid of something and found that your fear became less intense over time, the more you experienced something? For example, some people can be afraid of flying and find that the more they fly, the easier it gets. This is how exposure works. Very simply, the more that we do something we are afraid of doing, or are exposed to something that we are afraid of, the less afraid we tend to be.  Exposure is one set of skills used in CBT. With exposure, we gradually begin doing some of the things we tend to avoid, especially if these are things we need to do to reach our goals. The good news is that not only are we more likely to reach our goals if we donуt avoid, but by doing the exposure exercises the anxiety can actually become less, so we feel better. When we feel better, it is because the anxiety center of the brain, the amygdala, is getting less sensitive to a certain trigger. This is called desensitization. Weуll talk more about how this works later. Here are some examples of situations in which exposure principles can work: A taxi driver has a fear of traveling over bridges. He avoids bridges at all costs and will even pull over to the side of the road with a passenger in the car, pretending to have engine trouble. This fear of bridges severely limits his ability to do his job. With the help of a therapist, he learns gradually to beat his fear of bridges, starting by going over low bridges with a friend in the passenger seat. Eventually he works up to driving over larger bridges on his own. Bill, a college student, has a fear of public speaking. He tries to avoid taking classes that involve oral presentations and when he does have one of these classes, he tries to avoid giving presentations by missing class. He often fails to complete his work, and generally performs more poorly in these classes than he does in classes that do not involve presentations. Bill seeks out treatment to address this and gradually learns to speak in front of a few people, then small groups, and then ultimately larger audiences. With practice, he becomes more comfortable speaking in front of others. When can I use exposure? Exposure doesnуt work for all types of anxiety, and there are things we want to know before starting to use it. We hope that by the end of this part of the group youуll have an idea of when exposure can be helpful and how to use it. To get a sense of when exposure may be helpful, ask yourself the following questions: ╔Do I know exactly what is triggering my anxiety? ╔Isthere something important to me that I am avoiding because of the anxiety? ╔Arethere times when I try to stay safe or protect myself, which may affect my ability to live life the way I want to? Be sure to review рAnxiety Triggersс if you have trouble determining what your triggers are. Sometimes it is helpful to get the help of an experienced mental health professional to learn more about your triggers. In the section of the group entitled рAnxiety Fuelс we learned about the ways that avoidance and safety behaviors can make the anxiety worse. It may be helpful to review this section before beginning exposure exercises. As a rule of thumb, these behaviors interfere with the improvement we might experience using exposure techniques. Later in this section weуll be talking more about how safety behaviors can get in the way of our progress with exposure. Take home point: Exposure and desensitization is just one set of skills used in CBT. It works best when we know what triggers our anxiety, and are aware of avoidance and safety behaviors that we use when anxiety presents itself. The goal of exposure is to gradually expose ourselves to whatever it is that we are avoiding, which helps us reduce the anxiety and make progress toward our life aims. It is common to question whether or not to do exposure to reduce anxiety and stop avoiding important things in our lives. Why? Because facing our fears can be scary and takes hard work. Before and during exposure we may need to remind ourselves of why we are seeking treatment in the first place. It can be helpful to consider how avoiding inconveniences usя how it may keep us from achieving our goals. For example, Bill, our friend with public speaking anxiety, could list the ways avoidance impacts his life. Writing down the ways avoidance impacts our lives can help us understand how important it is to stop avoiding. We use exposure to work on the avoiding itself. Homework exercise:  How can I use exposure? Go back to the section рAnxiety Triggersс and list the triggers you wrote under рMy anxiety triggers areс here: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. Now use the  following questions to determine for what triggers exposure might work: ╔AmI avoiding any of these triggers because of    anxiety? ╔Arethere times when I am exposed to these  triggers and I try to stay safe or protect    myself, which may affect my ability to live my    life the way I want to? Now list some of the triggers for which the answers to these questions are рyes:с 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. How avoiding public speaking impacts mylife:! 1. I worry about the next speech.! 2. I have to try to take classes thatdonуt involve oral presentations.! 3. When I do speak in public, I feelmore anxious.! 4. I sometimes fail classes that involve public speaking.! 5. I may limit the types of careers thatare possible for me.! 6. I may not be able to move up in myprofession if I avoid publicspeaking.! Homework exercise:  Should I use exposure? Use Billуs example above to write down the ways that avoidance of some of these triggers either incon.veniences you or keeps you from achieving your goals. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. You may remember from the рAnxiety Fuelс section of the manual that we can think and do things that make the anxiety worse, like thinking over and over what might happen when we have to make that speech, or avoiding speeches altogether.   Anxiety can also get worse when bad things really happen, or we perceive that some event is dangerous. As we mentioned earlier, these events, safety behaviors and negative thoughts can make our anxiety alarm more sensitive to certain triggers. This is called sensitization. Desensitization is the opposite; our amygdala learns that something is not dangerous, through experience. Take our spider example: if this guy continues to approach the spider, it teaches the amygdala that the spider is not as dangerous as he once thought. If he is approaching that spider, it must not be that dangerousи рThis must not be that dangerousис = less рanxiety alarmс = Give it time! One trick about desensitization is that it usually takes time to retrain the amygdala to think something is not dangerous, especially if itуs been trained over the years to think it is. As we will discuss more later, one important thing about desensitization is staying in the anxiety provoking situation long enough to learn it is not dangerous. Since our amygdala wants to protect us, it needs a lot of convincing to be willing to turn down that anxiety alarm.  This is also called habituation, which means that we get used to something so that it no longer seems as scary to us. We will even get bored, if we stay with it long enough. This is OK, because it is better to be bored, than anxious! The next time we are around the trigger, we may still feel some anxiety, but it is likely to be less. If we do this over and over, the alarm gets weaker and weaker. Our anxiety рradarс may detect the trigger, but our amygdala will not react to it like it did before.  Take home point: Through experience and over time we can make our brain less sensitive to certain anxiety triggers. This is called desensitization. Desensitization, continued рOh, say can you seeис Imagine that you were asked to sing the Star-Spangled Banner on opening day at Comerica Park. Would you be nervous? Now imagine you were asked to do this for every Tigers gameп thatуs about 80 home games in a season. Would you be just as nervous after one month? At mid-season? At the end of the season? Beware of Dog! Elaine grew up around dogs all her life. Her family had many dogs, so she learned through experience that dogs tend not to be dangerous. When sheуd see something on the news about a dog attacking a person, sheуd think, рWow, that seems odd,с because in her experience dogs were not dangerous. This attack seemed like an isolated event and it did not change her opinion of how dangerous dogs are. Jessica did not have dogs in her home growing up. When she was six she saw a news clip in which someone was attacked by a dog. She got the impression that dogs were dangerousяeach time she was around a dog, she remembered that news clip and began to worry that the dog might attack her. She also felt scared and anxious when she saw a dog in real life. Jessicaуs friend Rachel got a dog the next year. Jessica gradually learned through experience that dogs werenуt always dangerous, and she began to feel less afraid. Wait just one second! You may be thinking рIуve exposed myself to this trigger over and over for a long time, and it hasnуt gotten any better; in fact, it is worse! Why would exposure make this any better?с There are some important rules about doing exposure that are necessary in order for it to work. Weуll talk about these rules in the section entitled рThe Exposure Formula.с Exercise: Try to think of some things to which youуve become desensitized in your life. Examples are driving, scary movies, roller coasters, air travel, etc. Think of things youуve gotten good at with practice, and also maybe some fears youуve overcome by being exposed to them over and over and over. Then write them down here. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. How do I know where to start? If different anxiety triggers interfere with your life and you are not sure where to start with exposure, ask yourself the following questions: 1. Which trigger interferes with my life the most? 2. With which one would I predict that my life would improve the most if the anxiety were less? 3. Does one stand out as being more рdoableс than others? Would one be easier to start on, so I can start to get my life back on track? Based on the questions above, try to pick the most pertinent exposure target. Once youуve chosen a trigger to start on, list ways that you might be able to get your anxiety alarm going. For example, Bill might write down different types of situations that would trigger his public speaking anxiety. We call this a Fear Hierarchy or a Stimuli Map.  Exposure exercise (different ways to trigger the anxiety) Anxiety Rating -Speaking in front of a large group of professionals who are experts on the 9! topic on which I am speaking, using a prepared speech! -Speaking in front of a large group of professionals who are experts on the 10!topic on which I am speaking, using a more impromptu style and few note cards! 6!-Speaking about myself in front of a few friends! -Speaking for a few people who I donуt know and who donуt know my topic well! 7! -Speaking for about 10 people who are also students and donуt know my topic 8! well! -Practicing a planned presentation on my own! 3! -Performing the speech for my girlfriend! 5! When trying to come up with ways to vary the exposure, think about things that can change how challenging the exposure is.

Distress Scaleс (SUDS) for each one. We discuss the SUDS It is good to come up with a nice long list at first, so try to think of as many variations as scale on the next page.  possible! Exposure: Getting Started, continued The SUDS Scale Exposure therapists often use a scale of 0-10 or 0-100 to rate the amount of anxiety someone has during exposure exercises.  It is like a thermometer, measuring how рhotс our anxiety gets. This is called the Subjective Units of Distress Scale or рSUDS.с 0= no anxiety at all; completely calm 3= some anxiety, but manageable 5= getting tough; wouldnуt want to have it all the time 7-8= severe anxiety that interferes with daily life 10 = worst anxiety youуve ever felt Why do I have to rate my anxiety? There are a few good reasons we ask folks to rate their anxiety before and during exposure treatment: 1. It helps us decide where to start and how to move from one exposure exercise to the next. 2. It keeps track of progress and helps us know if you are improving, staying the same, or getting worse. 3. It helps us start to step back from our anxiety when it happens and see that anxiety is not always the same           severity. We will be talking about the SUDS scale often in this manual and you will be using it a lot during exposure therapy.  Exercise: рMy Fear Hierarchyс Pick a trigger and try designing some exposure exercises by listing  possible ways to bring on the anxiety.  1. ___________________________________________________________________________________________________ 2. ___________________________________________________________________________________________________ 3. ___________________________________________________________________________________________________ 4. ___________________________________________________________________________________________________ 5. ___________________________________________________________________________________________________ 6. ___________________________________________________________________________________________________ 7. ___________________________________________________________________________________________________ 8. ___________________________________________________________________________________________________ 9. ___________________________________________________________________________________________________ 10. __________________________________________________________________________________________________ 11. __________________________________________________________________________________________________ 12. __________________________________________________________________________________________________                               Exposure exercise (different ways to trigger the anxiety                           Anxiety Rating (0-10) Exposure practice is like a formula; there are certain ingredients that are necessary to get the results we want. We need to understand these before starting the exposure practice, because if we donуt follow these rules, we arenуt likely to make much progress. In fact, we could make the anxiety worse! Weуll be talking more about this in the next section. There are four main ingredients in the рexposure formula:с 1. It is prolonged 2. It is repetitive 3. We focus on the anxiety 4. We add no safety behaviors Ingredient #1: Prolonged As we discussed earlier, it is important to stay in the anxiety producing situation until the anxiety comes down. Sometimes people ask if it is possible to do a shorter exposure practice in order to make it easier to complete. Usually we advise people to adjust the difficulty of the exposure, not the duration, because staying the situation long enough is necessary for the anxiety to come down. In fact, one important element of feeling better is staying in the situation long enough and doing it often enough that we eventually get bored with the trigger. This is important, because being bored it is a surefire way to know that we are not anxious! Ingredient #2: Repetitive Have you ever played a musical instrument or a sport? Your music teacher or coach probably told you to рpractice, practice, practice!с Repetition is important for our brain to learn anything, and anxiety is no exception. Some people notice that their anxiety goes down quickly after starting exposure, but most people find that it takes consistent, daily practice to adequately retrain the brain and feel better. Ingredient #3: Focus on the anxiety This is the part that can be difficult; we are going to ask that you try to focus on the feelings (the anxiety рalarmс) that come up when you are in the anxiety provoking situation. Why? Because we are trying to convince the amygdala that this trigger is not really dangerous. If we avoid these unpleasant feelings, we send the message that the trigger is dangerous, and our time spent practicing exposure is wasted. Ingredient #4: No рSafety Behaviorsс The same could be true if we spend our exposure practice trying to stay safe or protect ourselves from the trigger, or the anxiety itself. You may remember that safety behaviors are a great way to рfuelс our anxiety and make it stronger; they also really sabotage our exposure practice! We discussed some examples of safety behaviors in the section рAnxiety Fuel.с You may want to review this before starting exposure; it is another very important part of doing exposure correctly. Important! The #1 factor in seeing improvement with exposure is whether or not you do the exposure and use all of the ingredients listed above.  Take home points: The first step in exposure practice is setting up a рFear Hierarchyс and rating the amount of anxiety you would feel for each exercise. Exposure practice requires repetitive, prolonged exposures to the anxiety itself, with no рsafety behaviors.с Exposure seems simple; just expose yourself to something you are afraid of, and the anxiety comes down over time. While this is true, going through an exposure program sometimes seems anything but simple. We should be ready to troubleshoot when things get toughп and sometimes it can be confusing! Below are some tips to help you through the exposure and improve your results. Tip #1: Choose wisely! Throughout exposure, try to pick exercises you are confident you will complete. Often people become frustrated with exposure because it is рtoo hard,с and they may even leave the exposure practice early.  When first starting exposure, it is best to take something from your Fear Hierarchy in the р5с or р6с range on the SUDS and then very gradually increase the difficulty of the exposures. If you are having trouble with an exercise, try making it a bit easier and commit to becoming comfortable with that particular trigger.  When designing exposure exercises, it is helpful to try to make them convenient; in other words, make it hard to forget to practice, and schedule it into the day so it does not take a lot of extra work to get going. Give yourself every chance you can to follow through with the exposure. Tip #3: Unify your cognitive and behavioral рforcesс Imagine an army going into battle tentatively, with only half the number of soldiers, worried that there may be some casualties. How do you think they would fair against the enemy? Probably not so well.  Sending the message to the amygdala that the trigger is not dangerous works best when our thoughts and behaviors are aligned, a рunified frontс against our enemy, the anxiety.  If we have doubts about whether or not the anxiety provoking trigger is really dangerous and then try to do exposure, itуs like going into battle without all of our forces. The anxiety is likely to win the battle, because our negative thoughts continue to send the message that the trigger is dangerous. For example, when Bill goes to do exposure for his public speaking anxiety, he reminds himself of the evidence he has that making a mistake would not be the end of the world. We discuss the methods to do this in the Cognitive Therapy Skills module of this group manual. Tip #2:  Follow the rules of exposure As we emphasized on the last page, it is very important that all of the рingredientsс of the exposure formula be included in order to get good results. It is especially important that the person doing the exposure stay in anxiety provoking situation long enough for the anxiety to decrease. Review these concepts on the previous page. As we mentioned before, the #1 factor determining whether or not someone does well with exposure is whether or not they practiced exposure consistently and followed the rules. Tip #4: Be prepared for some discomfort and stay aggressive! Exposure can be difficult at times; after all, if we are going into battle, we should expect the enemy resist us with everything it has!  The main defense the anxiety has is discomfort, and we can expect to feel some during the exposure. Usually the discomfort is most severe early in the exposure, and some people even find that the anxiety gets worse before it gets better. This is our body trying to get us to give in and play defense; but we know our best bet is to stay aggressive and not listen to what the anxiety is telling us. We are going to try to рrideс the anxiety wave, always remembering that anxiety is uncomfortable, not dangerous! Exposure task: Performing my presentation for friends ! Length of time SUDS (0-10) Day/Date Start Stop Beginning  Middle        End Comments 4/15 10:15 am 11:15 am 2 8 4! 4/16 2:00 pm 3:00 pm 2 8 3! 4/17 5:30 pm 6:30 pm 1 9 4 Lost train of thought! 4/18 5:30 pm 6:30 pm 1 5 2! 4/19 10:00 am 11:00 am 0 4 1! 4/20 6:00 pm 7:00 pm 0 3 1! 4/21 10:15 am 11:15 am 0 2 .5! This is the type of progress we would expect to see for someone that consistently practices this one exposure exercise. You may notice that the рmiddleс levels are often highest, because it takes some time for the anxiety to come down.  We can also do multiple рminiс exposures to things that are harder to do for a full hour straight. For example, Jane, who has Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and fear of contamination, is practicing exposing herself to a rag that has been in contact with a door handle one time every hour, all day long.  Exposure task: Touching rag that had contact with door handle ! SUDS (0-10) Day/Date:  4/15  4/16  4/17  4/18  4/19  4/20  4/21!  8:00 am  8  8  7  5  3  4  3!  9:00 am  8  6  5  4  2  3  2  !  10:00 am  8  5  4  4  3  3  .5!  11:00 am  7  5  4  4  1  2  0!  12:00 pm1:00 pm2:00 pm3:00 pm4:00 pm5:00 pm6:00 pm7:00 pm8:00 pm9:00 pm10:00 pm 7 6 4 4 4 5 3 3 3 4 4  5 4 5 3 3 4 7 6 5 5 5  3 4 3 2 1 1 1 2 1 1 1  33 4 2 1 1 1 .5 1 1 2  . 5 1 1 .5 0 0 2 0 0 0 1  2 1 1 2 .5 0 0 0 0 0 1  0! 0! 0! 0! 0! 1! 0! 0! 0! 0! 0!  You may notice in both of these examples that there are times when the anxiety will come down, and then go up again. At other times the anxiety starts high and comes consistently down. When we record our SUDS scores this way, we can see that over time the numbers tend to come down, with some fluctuations in the middle. Step One: Pick a trigger Bill has decided he really wants to beat this fear of public speaking. He decides to focus on this target and commits to designing an exposure plan to reach his goal. Step Six: Ending exposure Bill continues to practice the exposure for about 12 weeks, changing the exposure exercise about each week as he moves up the hierarchy. After this, he decides to continue to practice public speaking, but less formally, to maintain his gains and refine his skills. Step Five: Middle sessions of exposure Once Billуs anxiety comes down to about a р3с or less on the SUDS consistently for 3-4 days, he moves on to the next highest item on his hierarchy. He goes to a Toastmasters group where he practices in front of people with whom he feels less comfortable. When he again habituates to this exercise, he moves on to the next.  Bill moves through his hierarchy until he feels comfortable speaking in front of superiors who are knowledgeable about his topic. Since it was hard to find superiors to help him practice exposure, he had to revise his hierarchy to create this fear as realistically as possible. For instance, he practiced speaking about current events at Toastmasters, because most people could be considered рexpertsс on these topics. For more information about Toastmasters, visit www.toastmasters.org. Step Two: Create a fear hierarchy Bill lists ways that he could purposely trigger the anxiety. He thinks about different ways to make public speaking situations more or less difficult.  Exposure exercise (different ways to trigger the anxiety) -Speaking in front of a large group of professionals who areexperts on the topic on which I am speaking, using a preparedspeech! -Speaking in front of a large group of professionals who areexperts on the topic on which I am speaking, using a moreimpromptu style and few notecards! -Speaking about myself in front of a few friends! -Speaking for a few people who I donуt know and who donуt knowmy topic well! -Speaking for about 10 people who are also students and donуt knowmy topic well! -Practicing a planned presentation on my own! -Performing the speech for my girlfriend! Step Three: Rate the hierarchy Bill rates each item on his list using the SUDS scale (see рExposure: Getting Startedс for more in-formation on the SUDS).  Exposure exercise  Anxiety Rating  -Speaking in front of a large group ofprofessionals who are experts on the topic onwhich I am speaking, using a prepared speech!  9!  -Speaking in front of a large group ofprofessionals who are experts on the topic onwhich I am speaking, using a more impromptustyle and few notecards!  10!  -Speaking about myself in front of a few friends!  6!  -Speaking for a few people who I donуt knowand who donуt know my topic well!  7!  -Speaking for about 10 people who are alsostudents and donуt know my topic well!  8!  -Practicing a planned presentation on my own!  3!  -Performing the speech for my girlfriend!  5!  Step Four: Starting exposure Bill picks an item from the list in the р5-6с range on the SUDS. He begins by speaking in front of his friends one hour each day for one week. He tracks his progress using the SUDS (see Exposure: Tracking Your Progress). He also follows the rules of exposure outlined in the section рThe Exposure Formula.с Internal cue exposure means that the trigger for our anxiety is internal, or inside our bodies. This type of exposure is used most often for people that struggle with Panic Disorder. Anyone who has had a panic attack knows how uncomfortable it is; this is the рfight or flightс response at its worst! Often the рtriggerс for panic attacks is body symptoms and feelings. Remember what we discussed in the рAnxiety Fuelс section? Uncomfortable body feelings can lead to worries about further anxiety symptoms, which then triggers more symptoms, which leads to more worries, and before we know it we are in the middle of a full-fledged panic attack.  Because the trigger for panic attacks within the context of Panic Disorder is the body, the exposure exercises center on the anxiety symptoms themselves. If we can become comfortable with the idea of having the anxiety symptoms, we train the brain that the anxiety is not really dangerous, and the anxiety рalarmс doesnуt need to be sounded as loudly or as often. These are also called interoceptive exposure exercises, which is a fancy way to say exposure to feelings of anxiety and panic in the body. Take a look at these interoceptive exposure exercises that can be used to toughen up against the possibility of having a panic attack. The person would pick a symptom that they experience when they have panic and practice one exercise daily. Each person may not respond to each exercise, so it is important try a number of them and find one that will trigger some anxiety.  Symptom: Rapid heartbeat -Run on the spot or up and down stairs for 1 minute,    then 1 minute break. Do this sequence 8 times. Symptom: Breathlessness or smothering feelings -Hold breath for 30 seconds, then breathe normally   for 30 seconds. Do this 15 times. -Breathe through a narrow, small straw (plug nose if   necessary) for 2 minutes, then 1 minute breathe normally. Do this 5 times. -Sit with head covered by a heavy coat or blanket. Symptom: Choking feelings, gag reflex -Place a tongue depressor on the back of the tongue (a few seconds or until inducing a gag reflex). Do   this repetitively for 15 minutes. Symptom: Trembling or shaking -Tense all the muscles in the body or hold a push-up    position for as long as possible for 60 seconds, then     rest 60 seconds. Repeat 8 times. Symptom: Sweating -Sit in a hot, stuffy room (or sauna, hot car, small room  with a space heater) -Drink a hot drink Symptom: Dizziness or lightheadedness -Spin slowly in a swivel chair for 1 minute, then 1 minute break.

Do this three times. Exposure Examples: рInternal Cue Exposure,с continued Letуs see what a course of interoceptive exposure for panic would look like. Janet is a 24 year-old woman with Panic Disorder. She has panic attacks that seem to come from рout of nowhereс and she often worries about having another panic attack. Sometimes she feels a little anxious and she begins to feel dizzy, which then makes her worry the panic will get worse; in fact, it usually does. Step One: Pick a trigger Janet decides to start with the рdizzinessс trigger, because it most often triggers panicky thoughts that fuel the anxiety and make it worse. Step Six: Ending exposure Janet continues to practice the exposure for about 10 weeks, changing the exposure exercise about each week as she moves up the hierarchy. This, with a combination of external cue exposure and cognitive skills, improves her panic symptoms and makes her feel confident that she can manage a panic attack in the future.  Step Five: Middle sessions of exposure Once Janet feels like her level of anxiety for the hyperventilation exercise has come down to around a р3с during the exercise, she moves on to the next harder exercise on the hierarchy. She continues to practice these exposure exercises daily. She continues to move up on the hierarchy until she becomes more used to the feeling of being lightheaded and dizzy, as well as more at peace with the possibility that she will have a panic attack when she feels dizzy. Since she also becomes worried when she experiences feelings of tightness in her throat, she decided to do some of these interoceptive exercises, as well. Along with her interoceptive exposure exercises, she added external cue exposure exercises (see previous page) to places that she avoided because she was worried about having a panic attack. Along with her exposure practice, Janet and her therapist worked on some of the thoughts that tend to рfuelс the anxiety once it is triggered. We will talk more about these thoughts in the Cognitive Therapy Skills module of the manual, in a section entitled рThe Only Thing We Have to Fear Isис Step Two: Create a fear hierarchy Janet lists the different interoceptive exercises she can use to trigger some anxiety, using a list she got from her therapist. Exposure exercise (different ways to trigger the anxiety) -Spin in a swivel chair for 1 minute, then 1 minute ! break.

Do this 8 times.! Step Three: Rate the hierarchy Janet rates each potential exercise using the SUDS scale (see рExposure, Getting Started,с for more information on the SUDS).  Exposure exercise  Anxiety Rating  -Spin in a swivel chair for 1 minute, ! then 1 minute break.

Do this 8 times.!  5!  Step Four: Starting exposure Janet picks an item from the list in the р5-6с range on the SUDS. She begins by practicing hyperventilating for one minute, then one minute rest, alternating 8 times, which takes her about 15 minutes. She tracks her progress using the SUDS by rating her level of anxiety before, during and after the exposure. She follows the rules of exposure outlined in the section рThe Exposure Formula,с and repeats this daily for one week. How long do I need to keep doing exposure? During each practice, do the exposure until the anxiety comes down by about half from where it started. Remember to use the SUDS scale to help you rate your anxiety.  Stay in the exposure situation for the full amount that you planned. We usually start with one hour as a rule of thumb. If it is boring, good! Stay with itп it is better to be bored than anxious! How do I know when to move on to the next exercise? When your anxiety is consistently below about a р3с on the SUDS for a few days, it is a good time to move to the next item on your hierarchy. What if it really is dangerous? If something really is dangerous, we will never ask you to do it. Exposure only works when we are avoiding or protecting ourselves around something that is not dangerous, or not so dangerous it is worth avoiding. Sometimes we are not sure if something is really dangerous, and it can be helpful to find out. Social situations are an example. We may think that trying to talk to people at a party is dangerous, because people may be critical of us. If we like the idea of going to the party but are afraid, perhaps it is best to get a sense of really how dangerous it is. We can do this using two different techniques: 1. Cognitive skills: looking at evidence to give us a sense of how dangerous it is.  Weуll be talking about this more in the next section of the manual. 2. Behavioral experiments: letуs try it out and get evidence first hand about whether or not it    is dangerous. Ask yourself what the real consequences are of having something bad happen. How do I know if I am done with exposure? Each person must decide when they want to stop doing exposure and move to using exposure principles in the course of daily life (see рThe Freedom of Choiceс). However, there are some points that may help you make this decision. 1. If you are still avoiding things related to the trigger in your daily life, it is best to continue to do the exposure. 2. It is best to really dominate the trigger you are working on before deciding to stop exposure. This means that you may even ramp up the exposure to ridiculous proportions. For example, if you are afraid of dogs, you might spend a weekend dog sitting for a friend; you could pet, rub, and play with the dog. A social phobic might volunteer to be the MC for a company event. Once someone becomes comfortable with something that difficult, it is easier to feel OK being exposure to the things we normally see in our daily lives. Structured, daily exposure practice often takes weeks or months to complete, depending on the type of problem. It is best to work with a mental health professional or exposure therapy workbook to determine how long to continue to do exposure therapy.  3. There will always be times when we feel challenged by anxiety and may have the urge to avoid. In this sense, we are never рdoneс with exposure; it becomes a way to address anxiety over the long term in our daily lives. My exposure questions Write down questions you have about exposure here and be sure to ask the group leader before you finish all the group sessions. 1. ________________________________________________________________________________________________? 2. ________________________________________________________________________________________________? 3. ________________________________________________________________________________________________? Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a chronic and often debilitating condition that affects thousands of people in the United States each year. OCD is characterized by obsessions (anxiety provoking, often intrusive thoughts) and compulsions (behaviors that aim to neutralize anxiety). These compulsions are also called rituals; they are рsafety behaviorsс that make the person feel less anxiety in the moment but serve to strengthen the anxiety in the long run.  When most people think about OCD they think about anxiety around contamination that may make someone want to wash their hands over and over. OCD has many forms, however; unfortunately we canуt go into them in detail here. Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for OCD is called Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP). You now know all about exposure; the рresponse preventionс part involves resisting the compulsionsя we рpreventс or рblockс our impulse to give in and do the ritual. In this way, we really stand up to the OCD and donуt do what it tells us to do. ERP looks a lot like other types of exposure, in that we purposefully expose ourselves to the anxiety-provoking trigger in order to show the brain that it is not really dangerous. But with OCD it is even more important not to add any safety behaviors (rituals), because these rituals are ultimately what keep the anxiety fire fueled and burning over the long run. For example, Jeremy tends to check thingsя irons, locks, stoves, the garage doorп because he feels anxious about the possibility that he has left something unlocked, plugged in, turned on, etc. He will check locks over and over, and never feels reassured that the locks are bolted, regardless of how many times he checks. He doubts himself constantly.  ERP for Jeremy involves purposely creating doubt that he locked something (exposure) and resisting the urge to check (response prevention). He works to see the OCD as something separate from himself: рItуs not me, itуs the OCD telling me to do that.с He practices ERP for 60 minutes a day and works to eliminate all OCD rituals in his daily life.  OCD is not rational! Another thing that makes OCD different from other anxiety disorders is that the person that the anxiety producing trigger is not rational and doesnуt make sense. Jeremy may try to reassure himself that the doors are locked and even see that they are locked, but his brain continues to signal that anxiety alarm.  For this reason, it does not help to try to rationalize with the OCD. In fact, when we try this the anxiety actually gets worse. Why? Because we are trying to reassure ourselves to get rid of the anxiety. What does this sound like? Yes, it is a safety behaviorп it tells the brain рIn order to be sure that I locked the doors I must continue to reassure myself that it is true.с This is a great way to рfuelс our anxiety! I have OCD and want help; what should I do? If you are planning to do exposure for OCD, it is best to work with a mental health professional who is trained to administer Exposure and Response Prevention. Here at the UM Anxiety Disorders Clinic we have treatment groups and individual therapists that are well-trained in delivering ERP for OCD. Ask us about how to get involved in ERP. There are also some self-help books and internet resources about OCD that are helpful; these are listed in the section рAppendix II: Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy Resources for Anxiety.с Take home point: Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder is slightly different than other anxiety disorders. OCD treatment involves Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP), which is similar to other types of exposure, with some modifications. If you have OCD and want to begin ERP, it is best to receive guidance from a mental health professional who is trained in ERP. 1. рI donуt have enough time to do this much exposure homework.с It is true that exposure takes a commitment of time and energy to work well. If we had evidence that exposure would work in less time, we would recommend to shorten the exposures! But, as we mentioned earlier, repetitive, prolonged exposure practice is essential to success. One question you may ask yourself is рHow much time does the anxiety take from me each day? Each month? Each year?с It could be that a commitment of time now could save you a lot of time in the future.  2. рThese exposure exercises do not fit my lifestyle well.с An important aspects of exposure work is finding ways to make exposure exercises convenient. Design them in ways that will increase the chances of doing them. This includes finding ways to remind you to do the homework. Plan times to do the homework when you will not be bothered and have all of the resources necessary to do it. For example, if someone were doing exposure to driving at night, they would need to plan to do the exposure at times when they are sure they can get the car.   3. рI feel terrible when I am doing the exposure; I donуt want to experience this.с As we mentioned before, for exposure to work we actually need to feel the anxiety during the practice session. When the anxiety gets worse it is a good sign that exposure is working! We just need to stick it out to the end of the exposure. If you are hoping not to feel any anxiety during the exposure, it may not be the right treatment for you. 4. рSometimes I do тsafety behaviorsу and I donуt even know I am doing them.с This is something that comes up often in exposure treatment. As treatment progresses, our goal is to learn more and more how we may be рfuelingс the anxiety fire with safety behaviors. The more we are aware of them, the sooner we can extinguish these behaviors. A therapist can be invaluable in identifying potential рcovertс safety behaviors and rituals.  5. рI hate having this anxiety and I donуt want to have to keep doing this!с Especially once treatment has gained some momentum, people often feel discouraged that they will need to continue to fight the anxiety over the long term. We definitely can resonate with this complaint and would like the anxiety to go away forever! However, we know that giving in to impulses to protect, avoid, and otherwise stay comfortable can make the anxiety even worse and keep us from achieving our goals. Accepting that the anxiety exists is necessary before we can do something to manage it. 6. рThis exposure isnуt working.с Before making a judgment about whether or not the exposure is working, be sure to review рThe Exposure Formulaс to be sure you are following all of the rules. Exposure does not work if we just do it рhalfway.с It is important to follow these guidelines in order to see improvement! Exercise: Think about and write down possible barriers to completing exposure therapy for one of your most impairing anxiety triggers, using the information above as a guide.  Take home point: 1._______________________________________________________________________ It is important to understand possible 2._______________________________________________________________________ barriers to exposure treatment and find 3._______________________________________________________________________ ways to work around them. 4._______________________________________________________________________ 5._______________________________________________________________________ Have you ever felt like anxiety is making choices for you? In many ways, exposure practice is about choices; the ability to choose what to do based on our goals and life aims, instead of what is safest or least anxiety provoking.  In the course of daily life we have many choices, and some of the hardest occur when we have to decide whether or not to рlistenс to the anxiety alarm that tries to keep us safe. We now know that making choices based on the anxiety can serve to make the anxiety stronger. It makes sense to have a way to counter this when the anxiety comes up during the day, using exposure techniques.  Once we have overcome a fear using exposure, we may Why would I start feeling anxiety again? find that we do not experience any anxiety at all around that certain trigger. This is good! There are many reasons that someone might begin to feel anxiety once again after using exposure successfully. It is also possible that we may have times in which we do feel some anxiety around a trigger that we think One reason is stress; we canуt predict when stressful things will weуve conquered.

Step Two: рAll right, anxiety, go ahead and stay around, I                       am going to go about my business.с Step two is an attempt to further accept the anxiety at that moment and resist the urge to avoid or protect ourselves. Step Three: рFine, itуs true that this plane is going to crash                     (or whatever the fear is). I canуt control that.с In the third step we рramp upс the approach by doing a рminiс exposure to the content of the fear. рBring it on! When addressing anxiety in the course of daily life, our attitude is the key.

Staying aggressive with anxiety in our daily lives helps to keep the anxiety from coming back in full force. Take home point: Exercise Either during or after a course of Design your own step-by-step plan to address anxiety in your daily life, using the example above: exposure therapy, it is important to have ways to handle anxiety triggers in Step One: _________________________________________________________ your daily life and use them over the long term.

Step Three:_________________________________________________________ In this part of the group manual we learned that exposure and desensitization is just one set of skills used in CBT. It works best when we know what triggers our anxiety and we are currently avoiding those triggers or using safety behaviors when we have to experience the trigger. The goal of exposure is to gradually expose oneself to whatever it is that is being avoided, which helps one to meet his or her life goals and reduce the anxiety. We also learned ways to decide whether or not exposure is right for us by understanding the ways that anxiety impacts our lives, and we learned about the principle of desensitization: through experience and over time we can make our brain less sensitive to certain anxiety triggers.  In the рGetting Startedс section we learned to begin exposure by creating a fear hierarchy and using the SUDS scale (anxiety scale of 0-10) to rate the difficulty of each possible exposure exercise. In the section рThe Exposure Formulaс we learned that exposure practice involves repetitive, prolonged exposures to the anxiety itself, with no рsafety behaviors.с We then offered tips to maximize the effectiveness of the exposure, and ways to рtrackс the exposure progress using the Subjective Units of Distress Scale (SUDS) я we rate the anxiety on a scale of 0-10 or 0-100. We then learned how a course of exposure looks in the sections titled рExposure Examples.с We looked at examples of addressing Panic Disorder using Internal Cue Exposure and exposure to anxiety triggers in our environment (External Cue Exposure). We then discussed ways to use exposure to treat Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder using a variation of exposure treatment, Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP). We learned about some common barriers to exposure treatment and discussed why it is important to understand these possible barriers to find ways to work around them. In the section рThe Freedom of Choice: Exposure in Daily Lifeс we discussed the importance of learning to use exposure techniques when anxiety presents itself in the course of daily life. This helps one manage anxiety over the long term. We learned that we should expect to have anxiety come up at times and be ready to use skills when it does. Moving onи The exposure skills we covered in this section can be used to help us wage our fight against the рanxiety enemy.с Other skills, including cognitive (thinking) and relaxation skills are often used with exposure to gain more ground on the anxiety. In the next two sections of this manual we will learn about these other skills, which can be used either alone, or with the exposure skills. List your anxiety trigger below and the list possible exposure exercises that might elicit anxiety.

We discuss how to identify, understand, and respond to our thoughts as a way to help us feel better. We will help you identify the thoughts that are troubling to you and understand them as well as possible. We then discuss the basic techniques that we use to begin to respond to and modify these thoughts. We respond to thoughts by gathering facts, or рevidence,с to see a situation as realistically and in as detailed a way as possible. Later in the module we go into some detail to discuss the thoughts associated with two common types of anxiety: ╔  рThe fear of fearсяfear of the anxiety itselfяwhich is commonly    associated with Panic Disorder. It is also a common part of all    anxiety disorders. ╔ Worryп often part of рGeneralized Anxiety Disorderс but also a    common part of most anxiety problems. Join us as we learn to change our relationship with our thoughts with Cognitive Therapy Skills! You may remember from рGroup Guidepostsс that thoughts, behaviors, and emotions influence one another.  Cognitive is a technical word used to describe anything related to thoughts. In this module, we explore how it is that our thoughts can lead to negative emotions, and what we can do about it. Thoughts Behaviors Cognitive Therapy Skills involve responding to and modifying our thoughtsя (actions) (cognitions) to help us cope better in our daily lives and feel less anxious.  How do Cognitive Therapy Skills Work? The main goal of cognitive skills is to gather evidence. Like a detective, we look to uncover facts about something that has happened in the past or is happening right now. By examining our thoughts, beliefs, and basic assumptions in detail, we can learn to make informed choices about issues that impact us. For example, we may find that a thought is not completely true; this helps us decrease our efforts to protect ourselves and lowers our anxiety. Another option is to take these facts and do something with themп to problem solve. Finally, these facts may help us understand that nothing can be done to change a situation; we work to accept this and let go of our efforts to control. In order to choose one of these options we use cognitive skills to understand thoughts and situations as well as possible. Examining the Evidence Scientists and detectives are good at asking the right questions to better understand a situation. With cognitive skills we learn which questions to ask to best explain an anxiety-producing situation. For example: 1. What is the likelihood that this anxiety-producing event will happen? 2. If this event were to happen, how bad would it be? Would it be tragic? 3. What would I do if something bad happened? How would I handle it? 4. Is there any other explanation to account for what has happened? 5. Do I know all of the facts about this situation? Put on your рhappy face?с Cognitive Therapy Skills are not just about рthinking positively.с While being aware of positives is a part of CBT, we want to gather all evidence, good and bad, to understand best how to cope with a situation.  For example, we know that driving on the highway has some risks associated with it. However, for most of us driving on the highway is a necessary part of everyday life. We are willing to take this risk because if we didnуt our lives would be limited. A positive aspect of driving on the highway is that it helps us achieve our goals. A negative one is that under some circumstances it can be dangerous. When we examine the evidence, we find itуs true that there are рtwo sides to every coin.с Practice makesи the brain change? When we modify thoughts, we actually change the brain! Practicing different types of thought patterns over and over actually rewires our brain so that new, more realistic and helpful patterns of thought can become more natural. This does not mean that our brains are permanently changed  by thinking something new just once. It takes consistent practice to keep the brain functioning  well, just like it takes consistent exercise to keep the body healthy. Cognitive skills can  help us keep our brains healthy, if we are willing to stay well-practiced at it. рWhat are Cognitive Therapy Skills,с continued In the рAnxiety Fuelс section of the manual we discussed the рsnowball effectс that is created when negative thoughts, avoidant or protective behaviors, and uncomfortable anxiety symptoms get mixed. Thoughts can serve to make our anxiety worse and even cause more problems for us, especially if they convince us to avoid what makes us anxious.  Letуs take our example of Bill, our friend from the Exposure and Desensitization module, who has a fear of public speaking. He has many negative thoughts about speaking in public that come up when he starts to work on his speech. These thoughts cause him to want to avoid anything connected with the speech: he may procrastinate and not prepare for the speech adequately or try to get out of the speech completely. Do any of the thoughts below sound familiar to you?        рWhat if someone notices I am nervous?с рI am going to screw this up.с        рPeople will laugh at me.с рI am going to fail this class.с        рI may even have to drop out of school.с рI am not a good public speaker.с Most of us can relate to Billуs dilemma; when he has these thoughts it increases his anxiety and makes him want to avoid the speech even more. When we look at our thoughts realistically and in a detailed way, we рthrow water on our anxiety fire.с Responding to and modifying these negative thoughts so they are more realistic can help to keep us from triggering the anxiety over and over again. Most importantly, they can help to keep us from avoiding things that are important to us. For example, if Bill avoids his class, it could impact his grade, his program, and ultimately his career.  When should I use Cognitive Therapy Skills? Cognitive skills can help us with most types of anxiety problems. They work best whenи          и we can identify negative thoughts that make us              feel worse in certain situations         иanxiety is triggered by worries about the future             and/or negative thoughts about ourselves Important! For patients that have Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), some types of cognitive skills may not be helpful. You may remember from the Exposure and Desensitization module that OCD is best treated with Exposure and Response Prevention, a specific style of exposure treatment. If you have OCD it may be best to work with an individual or group therapist to learn which skills you can use to treat OCD. That being said, it could still be useful to practice the skills in this module to learn to handle daily stress and worry that may exist separate from the OCD. рUnifying our Cognitive and Behavioral Forcesси revisited In the section on Exposure and Desensitization, we discussed the importance of рunifying our cognitive and behavioral forces.с Working with thoughts is just one part of our defense against anxiety; simply learning to think differently can be very helpful. However, we canуt underestimate the importance of behavior in maintaining our anxiety. For example, if we continue to avoid speaking in public, the anxiety is very likely to be there when we actually do go to make a speech, regardless of how we think. Unifying our forces means learning to use cognitive skills while practicing confronting our fears with action. As we will state often in this group, effective anxiety management means using lots of different рforcesся CBT skillsя to battle anxiety.  Take home points: Cognitive skills are one set of skills used in CBT. Our goal is to examine the evidence to uncover the facts, both positive and negative, about a situation. By understanding a situation better, we learn to think realistically about the likelihood of bad things happening; we also work to find ways to cope in case those things do happen.   We all have them. Sometimes they pop into our heads uninvited. Sometimes they stick in our heads for hours. Negative automatic thoughts are negative thoughts that come automatically to us when we are feeling anxious, depressed, angry, frustrated; they can come any time we have a negative emotion.   There are different types of negative automatic thoughts. Worry is related to fear that something bad might happen in the future. Most troubles with anxiety have some sort of worry attached. For example, the thought in the upper left corner of this page is a worry about what might happen if this person loses his or her job.   Another type of negative automatic thought is a negative statement about ourselves, other people, or the world at large. рI am an idiotс is a good example. It is not a worry, but rather a declarative statement; but it sure can make us feel bad! Often people with depression have these types of thoughts. Cognitive skills can work on these thoughts, too. In this manual, though, weуll be focusing primarily on the anxiety-related thoughts and worries.  Why do I have all of these negative thoughts? You may remember from the рAnxiety Isис section that the рfight or flightс response automatically causes negative thoughts. You may ask рWhy do I think so many negative thoughts when I am anxious? When I am feeling relaxed I donуt have these thoughts much at all.с As we discussed earlier, there are good reasons we experience negative thoughts when we are anxious. When we are anxious, the brain wants us to think about potentially dangerous things in our environment, in order to keep us safe. We want our anxiety radar to be sensitive if there is actual danger out there.  Imagine what would happen if we did not have negative thoughts when we were in dangerи we probably wouldnуt try to protect ourselves! If we really are in danger, it is helpful to have negative thoughts because we are more likely to try to stay safe if we think something is dangerous. The trouble is, sometimes we know that things are not dangerous, yet we have these thoughts anyway. That is why we use cognitive skills to help our brains get on board with what we knowп that right now, we are safe. рChicken and Eggс revisitedи On page 10 we discussed the рchicken and the eggс phenomenonяanxiety can make a situation seem more dangerous, while a dangerous situation can also trigger anxiety. The same thing holds true for thoughts: negative automatic thoughts certainly can cause anxiety, while when we are anxious we are more likely to have these negative thoughts. Anxiety Negative Automatic Thoughts Negative Automatic Thoughts, continued Types of Negative Automatic Thoughts Anxiety causes people to assume the worst. There are many different types of anxiety producing thoughts, and it is helpful to be aware of some of the kinds of thoughts that many people with anxiety experience.  1. Overestimating the likelihood of negative events happening: One of the most common tendencies when we are anxious is to predict that dangerous things will happen in the future. We often imagine that something may happen, even when logically we know that it is not likely to happen. For example, Bill may predict that рeveryone will think I am stupid if I make one mistake during my presentation.с 2. Catastrophizing: This is a fancy way of saying that we predict things would be рhorribleс or рawfulс if something bad actually were to happen. We may predict that we would not be able to cope, and we may try to find ways to prevent it from happening to avoid catastrophe.  3. Beliefs that anxiety itself is dangerous: We often have negative thoughts about the anxiety itself. We may predict that we will рgo crazy,с рlose control,с not be able to function, have a heart attack, pass out, or suffocate when anxiety symptoms get more extreme.  4. Belief that one cannot tolerate discomfort, pain, or negative events: We question our ability to cope with future events because of the anxiety: рIf I canуt tolerate this, what will happen if something really bad happens?с We tell ourselves рI cannot take thisс when we experience discomfort and/or pain. 5. Positive beliefs about worry: Anxiety and worry often seem to have a protective function. We may say to ourselves рIf I donуt worry about this it may actually happen.с Sometimes anxiety helps us get things done that we might otherwise avoid; we rely on it for motivation, even if it is uncomfortable at the same time. 6. Negative thoughts about ourselves, others, the world: We make negative assumptions and blanket statements such as рI am a loser,с рNobody will ever like me,с or рThe world is a dangerous place.с These types of statements can make us feel more anxious, and more depressed, as well.   We all have some patterns of negative thinking, depending on our experience; but sometimes these patterns can get out of control. When these patterns are severe, an anxiety disorder may be at work. Each anxiety disorder has characteristic negative automatic thoughts associated with it. Here are some examples of negative automatic thoughts related to each disorder: Diagnosis  Thoughts  Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)  рI am going to lose my job. I may even end up homeless if that   happens.с  Social Anxiety Disorder  рPeople donуt like me.с  рPeople may notice my anxiety and think I am weak.с  Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia  рI will have another panic attack.с  рThis time I could have a heart attack.с  Specific Phobias  рThe plane could crashи I will worry about this for the whole flight.с  Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) рIf I do not count to four each time I feel anxious, something bad could    happen to my husband.с Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) рThe world is a dangerous place; there is nothing I can do to keep     myself safe.с рA stronger person would have gotten over this by nowс The first step to begin рrestructuringс or responding to negative thoughts is to identify the thoughts that give us trouble. Itуs as if we are putting a magnifying glass to our minds to learn more about how we think. Use the following tips to identify the thoughts youуll start working on using cognitive skills. Once you have identified a thought, write these thoughts down using the Daily Thought Record Worksheet. How to Identify Negative Automatic Thoughts 1. In the course of daily life, write down thoughts that come up when you are feeling anxious. 2. Sit quietly and try to imagine going into an anxiety producing situation: what thoughts come up? 3. Recall an event from the past that was anxiety-producing. What thoughts were going through your mind? 4. Role play an anxiety-producing event with a friend, family member, or therapist. Write down thoughts that come up during this exercise. When Identifying Thoughtsи иphrase the thoughts in the form of a statement, and avoid рwhat ifуsс and questions. For example, if the thought is рWhat if I lose my job?с it would be better to phrase it рI will lose my job.с иbe specific about the fear. It is better to break more general thoughts up into more manageable pieces. If the thought is рI feel like something bad is going to happen,с make a list of the specific things that you worry might happen. Write down the first negative automatic thoughts that come into your head. You might use the рThought Cascadeс approach, to the left, to learn more about what is scary to you. иnotice the thoughts that seem to come up often or are more impairing than others. You may want to begin with these when you start working on the thoughts. Take home points: The first step of cognitive рrestructuringс is to identify negative automatic thoughts and record them in the form of the statement. There are many techniques that can be used to do this, such as writing down thoughts in the course of daily life, visualizing anxiety-provoking situations, and using the Thought Cascade method.  Exercise: Use the techniques on this page to begin to identify some of your negative automatic thoughts. Use the Daily Thought Record and the Thought Cascade Worksheet to record them for later. One Thing Leads to Another: The рThought Cascadeс When we are feeling anxious, it is common to have a thought that leads to a more disturbing thought, which then leads to an even more disturbing thought, and so on, like this: рI am going to lose my job.с рI wonуt be able to pay my bills.с рI will lose my house and end up homeless.с рI will die homeless and pennilessс Believe it or not, this рdomino effectс of negative automatic thoughts is common. We can use this technique to uncover some of our most troublesome worries.  When we are feeling anxious, it is common to have a thought that leads to a more disturbing thought, which then leads to an even more disturbing thought, and so on. Believe it or not, this type of рdomino effectс of negative automatic thoughts is common. We can use this technique to uncover some of our most troublesome worries. Once you find some that are particularly difficult or relevant for you, you can use the Examining Thoughts Worksheet to begin working on them. To use this technique, first write down a thought in the form of a statement, as in the example below. Then ask yourself: рWhat would be so bad about that?с In other words, what other bad things might happen should the event happen? Example рI am going to lose my job.с рI wonуt be able to pay my bills.с рI will lose my house and end up homeless.с рI will die homeless and pennilessс Your thoughts What would be so bad if that happened? What other bad things might happen if this happens? What would be so bad if that happened? Your Thoughts Your Thoughts Your Thoughts Try using these tricks to identify negative automatic thoughts: ╔ Sit quietly and try to imagine going into an anxiety producing situation: what types of thoughts might come up? ╔ Recall an event from the past that was anxiety-producing.

While we know how we really look, what we see in the mirror looks different than what is real.  When we are anxious, the facts of a situation can become distorted, too. Cognitive distortions are patterns of thinking that are heavily influenced by our emotions. As you will see when you review the list of cognitive distortions, these distortions tend to follow certain patterns, and many of them overlap with others. Here are some рfun factsс about cognitive distortions: 1. Cognitive distortions tend to be extreme: there is often a рblack-and-whiteс or рall-or.nothingс quality to these thoughts.  2. They tend to emphasize negatives at the expense of positives. As we mentioned earlier, we are programmed to think of negatives first when we feel anxious, because our bodies are trying to protect us.  3. They tend to be general instead of specific. In the Exposure and Desensitization module we used the example of Jessica, our young friend with a fear of dogs. After she saw a news story about someone being bitten by a dog, she became afraid that she might get bitten herself. Some of her negative automatic thoughts might have been рAll dogs are dangerousс or рI am going to get bitten by a dog if I get too close to one.с While it is true that dogs can occasionally be dangerous, there are qualities of these thoughts that are not true. We may call them рdistortedс because of the extreme nature of the thoughts: рallс dogs are not dangerous and most dogs do not, in fact, bite the people with whom they come into contact. What do I do when my negative          automatic thoughts do not seem to be          distorted? Sometimes anxiety producing thoughts are not completely distorted. In fact, there is some truth to almost all of our thoughts. The worry рI am going to lose my jobс may have some truth: it is always possible that one could lose their job. If one has determined that it is, in fact, likely that they will lose their job, we would say that this thought is not distorted. However, at this point we would want to use the Thought Cascade approach to get to some related thoughts, such as рIf I lose my job I will end up homeless and destitute.с We would then want to look at possible distortions in that thought, and so on. As we will discuss more later, our main goal is to learn how likely it is that something bad will happen, while also learning how to cope when bad things do happen to us, so whether or not a thought is distorted, we still have work to do!  So, for the purpose of these exercises, record the possible distortion for each thought, even if you are convinced that the thought is not distorted.  Why is it important to understand          cognitive distortions? Understanding cognitive distortions is an important part of understanding our thoughts and preparing to work on them using cognitive therapy skills. By understanding some common faulty patterns of thinking, it is easier for us to notice our own patterns during the course of our daily lives. The more we notice these patterns, the more likely we are to be able to modify these thoughts and start feeling better. So here they are! Read through the list of cognitive distortions on the next page, and circle the numbers of those that you suspect may apply to you.  1. Black-and-White Thinking: We see things, events, and people as perfect or terrible, all good or all bad. We say рalwaysс or рneverс often, not seeing the рgrey zoneс that is almost always there. 2. Catastrophizing: We react to a disappointment or failure as though it means the end of the world. 3. Jumping to Conclusions: We assume the worst without checking the evidence. We decide that someone dislikes us, but we don't check it out; or we predict that terrible things will happen even when there is no evidence for this.  4. Ignoring the Positive: We don't pay attention to positive experiences, or we reject them or say they somehow "don't count.с 5. рMy Fault!с: We take blame or responsibility for things outside of our control, or are not our job. 6. рShoulds:с We criticize ourselves or other people with ideas about what absolutely рshouldс be done without considering where we get this idea. We ignore the reasons we might have done what we did, or think we could have had knowledge we couldnуt have actually had. рShouldsс sometimes leave us feeling inadequate despite our attempts to be self-motivating. 7. Magnifying and Minimizing: We define ourselves by our shortcomings and minimize our strengths.  8. Labels: Instead of focusing on peoplesу behaviors, we make blanket statements: рI am such an idiotс or рHeуs such a jerk.с  9. Perfectionism: We believe that all mistakes are bad and to be avoided. Because of this, we donуt take the necessary risks to be successful. We may also try to control all circumstances and make them fit what we think is right.  10. Reasoning From Our Emotions: We believe that because we feel a certain way, that indicates the truth about a situation, and we may even act accordingly even if it hurts us in the long run. Exercise Write down some of the thoughts you identified earlier. Identify potential distortions related to each thought.  ____________________Thought _____________________________________________________Distortion_________________ Take home points: When we are anxious, it is possible that our thoughts are рdistortedс in some way. Cognitive distortions are thoughts that are heavily influenced by emotions and may not be consistent with the facts of a situation. An important part of cognitive skills is identifying ways that thoughts may be distorted and noticing patterns in our thinking. As we become more aware of these patterns, we are better able to modify anxiety-producing thoughts.  Examining the Evidence рRestructuringс Negative Automatic Thoughts Imagine you are a scientist studying the causes of pollution in a local river. How would you approach this? What types of questions would you ask to uncover the truth? You might look at local industry, plant populations, or invasive species as potential causes. You might look closely at samples of the water to determine what types of pollutants are in the water. Youуd want to get as much information as you could to be sure you were right about what you find. Scientists know that there are many possible explanations for an event or phenomenon. They spend countless hours trying to prove or disprove their hypotheses about what is happening and why it happens. To do this, they set up experiments; ultimately the goal is to find the best possible explanation for something. They might ask questions like: рWhat are all the possible explanations for this event? Are there any other possibilities?с Now imagine this scenario: you are walking down the street or hallway and you see someone you know fairly well. You look at them to say hello and they look away and say nothing in return. What types of interpretations might you have about this event? Perhaps you might think рThey must not like me-- if they did they would have said hello to me,с or рThey must be mad at me.с What if we replaced these knee-jerk reactions with a more scientific approach? We could look for other explanations, just like the scientist. What are some other explanations to why this person did not look at you and say hello? List some here: 1._________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 2._________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 3._________________________________________________________________________________________________________ What you just did is a simple example of examining the evidence, the most important element of cognitive restructuring, a common cognitive therapy skill. рRestructuringс a thought means gathering evidence to see a situation more completely and realistically, which can help us feel better.  Cognitive Restructuring: Basic Questions When working on our anxiety-related negative automatic thoughts, we look at different lines of evidence for each problem, to get closer to the truth about that situation. We call the answer to these questions the rational response. We typically start with two basic lines of evidence when addressing anxiety-producing thoughts: 1. How likely is it that this event will happen? Research has shown that when people are anxious they typically overestimate the likelihood that something bad will happen. For example, we may worry about the possibility of losing our job because the economy weakens, without knowing the details of how it specifically impacts our company. We may predict that we are on the flight that will crash into the ocean. To get some more details about the likelihood of something bad happening, we ask questions like: ╔Whatpercentage likelihood is it that this event will   happen? Am I 100% sure? 50% sure? ╔Whatevidence do I have that this is likely to     happen in the future? ╔Isthere any evidence that it is not likely? ╔Howmany times have I predicted this would     happen? How many times has it actually happened? Our goal here is not to try to prove that this event will not happen; instead we try to make a realistic assessment of how likely something is. 2. If it did happen, how bad would it be? Would I be able to cope? What would I do if this happened? We also know that, when we are anxious, we tend to catastrophize. This simply means that we tend to blow out of proportion how bad something would be if it did happen. We often predict that we would not be able to handle a negative event if it occurred. We also donуt think much about what we would actually do if this event happened. For example, most people, if faced with the challenge of losing their job, would eventually get back out and start looking for another job. Often we do not think this far ahead; we stop after the thought about how bad it would be for something to happen and we focus on preventing that thing from happening.  To look at this question, we might ask ourselves how bad it would really be if this happened. What would we do if the event happened? How we might be able to cope with it and move on? If it did happen, what would be the worst consequence? By looking at this basic question in a more detailed way, we may find that we could cope if this unfortunate event actually did happen. Are you a gambler? Think of the last time you made a bet with someone. How much did you bet? How confident did you have to feel in order to make that bet? 100% sure? 50% sure? You may know that people that bet on horse races often look at the odds a certain horse has to win before placing their bet. People like to know how likely it is that they will win, or lose, money before making their decision. We donуt often use the same system to gauge the chances of a negative event happening in our lives. Research has shown that when people are anxious they typically overestimate the likelihood that something bad will happen. It would be like betting all our money that the underdog horse is going to win, because we are feeling lucky that day. This style of negative thought features predictions. You may remember from the page on Cognitive Distortions that this is also called рFortune Telling.с When it comes to anxiety, we will find it is better to get all the information before betting that something will happen. We look at different lines of evidence to get to the key question: рHow likely is it that this negative event will happen?с Remember, we are looking at any evidence, not just evidence disputing our fear. Some lines of evidence are: ╔Whatpercentage likelihood is it that this event will happen? Am I 100% sure? 50% sure? ╔Whatevidence do I have that this is likely to happen in the future? ╔Isthere any evidence that it is not likely? ╔Howmuch money would I bet that this will happen? ╔Howmany times have I predicted this would happen? How many times has it actually     happened? Exercise Think of a fear you have about the future. Use the techniques on earlier pages to identify a thought that is particularly difficult. For now, focus on predictions, thoughts like рI will lose my jobс or рShe will reject me.с Write it on the left. Remember to phrase it in the form of a statement. On the right, write the answers to the questions listed above. Thought (prediction) Answers to questions above (rational response) When you are finished, you should have a good idea of the likelihood that this event will happen. Sometimes we realize that this event really is not likely, and we determine that it is not worth the effort trying to protect ourselves or fix the problem. Then we can remind ourselves of this evidence when we get that thought.  Of course, sometimes bad things actually do happen. If it really is likely that something bad could happen, we go to the next important question: рIf something bad did happen, how bad would it be?с We discuss this on the next page. Remember that the purpose of the material above is to make a realistic assessment of how likely something is. This is one important part of examining the evidence. Imagine that someone called you on the phone and said рCome home quick-- something horrible has happened!с What types of events would you think may have happened? List a few possibilities here: 1. ________________________________________________________________________________ 2. ________________________________________________________________________________ 3. ________________________________________________________________________________ Most people would define рhorribleс events as рcatastrophicс or рlife changing.с Think about some of the thoughts and worries you identified on earlier pages. How do they compare with the events listed above? We know from research that when people are anxious, they tend to catastrophize: they blow out of proportion how bad something would be if it happened. Because of this, a big part of cognitive restructuring is getting more evidence to answer the question: рHow bad would it be if this event did happen?с What if horrible things really have happened,  or could happen, to me? Of course, sometimes horrible things do happen, and when they do, it is likely we will experience some anxiety about these events. In fact, we all should expect that we will be confronted with very difficult circumstances at some point in our lives; after all, there is no way to prevent bad things from happening forever!  When horrible things happen, we have to find ways to grieve our losses and learn to cope so that we can eventually move on with our lives. An important part of CBT is learning to cope better when bad things really do happen. The рCatastro-meterс Have you ever had the thought, рI know it is not likely that it will happen, but if it did, it would be terrible.с It can be helpful to look more closely at a potentially difficult event to determine how bad the event would be, and how we would cope if that event did happen. Letуs use the рcatastro-meterс to rate different types of challenging events to measure how catastrophic these events would be if they happened. Rate each of these events on a scale of 0-10 in terms of how hard it would be to cope with the event: 0= would have no trouble coping at all               3=would have a few bad days as a result, but recover pretty quickly               5=would take substantial time to recover, but no doubt it would happen                7-8=would be impaired for a while               10=would fall apart, go crazy, never recover _____Argument with friend or loved one _____Death of a loved one _____Get injured in a car accident _____Loss of job _____Heard someone said something mean about you _____Home gets flooded _____ ________________________________(insert your own here) _____ ________________________________(insert your own here) One goal of this exercise is to notice the difference between different types of negative events. We can learn that not all bad events have the same degree of severity. Catastrophizing (continued) Another common tendency we have when we are anxious is to underestimate our ability to cope with difficult events. We may think that we will not be able to handle the emotions associated with a challenging event. Think back to some difficult events you have had in the past. How did you handle them? How long did it take to get over them? Pick a few events and do the following exercise to get some evidence about your ability to cope with tough circumstances.    Past tough event                                          What I did to cope How long it took to overcome this and move on Were you able to cope? Have you moved on from these events, or are you still mired in their consequences? If you were able to cope, this may give you some good evidence that you are better at coping than you thought you were. If you feel you were not able to cope, a part of the work you do in therapy could be to work on developing some coping skills to better handle future negative events. Many of the techniques we learn in Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy can be helpful to learn to cope with difficult events.  Based on your written examples on the last two pages, do the following exercise, gathering evidence about how bad the predicted event would be, as well as whether or not you could find a way to cope with it. Remember, we are trying to look at the situations realistically, so there should be both positive and negative evidence. Exercise Think of a prediction about the future that leads to anxiety. Do the exercise on page 48 to determine if it is likely that it will happen. If you determine that it is likely it will happen, or you worry that it would still be horrible if it did happen, write the thought on the left, below. Remember to phrase it in the form of a statement. On the right, write the answers to the questions (lines of evidence) listed here. ╔If this happened, would it be horrible? ╔Whatare the likely consequences of this happening? ╔If it did happen, would I be able to cope? ╔If it did happen, what would I do? ╔Would I always be affected by this, or would I eventually get over it? Thought (prediction) Answers to questions above (rational response) Over the last three pages, we discussed the two main questions we ask when trying to learn more about an anxiety provoking situation. Once we know which questions to ask, we must start to record our evidence to build a strong, realistic argument. When we are beginning to use cognitive restructuring, it is helpful to write down our thoughts, distortions, and evidence until we get the hang of it. Here is one method we use to do this is. You will notice in the example below that this approach uses the skills of identifying thoughts and thought distortions that we practiced on previous pages. We add the рrational responseс in the third column. The evidence we gather there is what we will use to remind ourselves of the truth about the situation when we are feeling anxious.   Take thoughts identified using techniques in the рIdentifying Negative Automatic Thoughtsс section and write them here. Thought She didnуt say much of ahello. She must hate me.! I have no friends. No one likes me.! Iуll never find a wife. Iуll always be alone.! She must think Iуm an idiot.! If she says no it will beawful!!! Use what you learned from the section рCognitive Distortionsс to identify any possible thought distortions. Possible Distortion Jumping toconclusions! Black-and-white thinking! Jumping toconclusions! Labels! Magnification!    Get out that pen and paper! Research shows that people who write things down as part of CBT practice do better than those that try to do it all in their heads. While it does involve more work (and may seem like going back to school), we hope you will give it a try at first, until the skills become more natural. Gather evidence for and against your negative automatic thoughts using multiple lines of evidence. Rational Response It is possible he was thinking aboutother things and does not hate me. Infact he did ask me to lunch last weekи etc.! Not true! Jim is my friend. John and Joetalk to me a lot, they seem to like me. I ! could join the company team and makemore friends, etc.! Wait! I am not alone now; I have some ! friends. I would like more dates; maybeI could join a dating service, etc.! True, she may say no but she may sayyes. I will miss out for sure if I do nottry, etc.! Sure, it would hurt but probably notforever. If I practice getting rejected itmay help me worry less about it, etc.! Important: Gather lots of evidence! You may have noticed the рetc.с after each rational response in the examples above. What we are trying to communicate is the importance of gathering as much detailed evidence as possible. For each negative automatic thought, we may have as many as 7 to 10 facts listed. We use multiple lines of evidence to do this. Each рline of evidenceс aims to help us illuminate a certain aspect of a situation. For example, one common line of evidence is oneуs own personal experience, examined in detail. Another might be the perspective of friends and family.  On the following pages we look at specific types of anxiety, such as panic, and the lines of evidence we can use to help us gather evidence about these issues. Use the Examining Thoughts Worksheet on the next page to record the evidence you gather.   Take thoughts identified using Use what you learned in the Gather evidence for and against techniques in the рIdentifying рCognitive Distortionsс section to your negative automatic thoughts Negative Automatic Thoughtsс identify any possible thought using multiple рlines of evidence.с section and write them here. patterns. Possible Thought Distortion(s) Rational Responses 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. Possible Thought Distortion(s) Rational Responses 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. Tips: -Remember to phrase each thought in the form of a statement. -You should have between 7 and 10 facts in the рrational responseс column for each thought. -Copy this page to use for other thoughts (some extra pages are included at the end of the manual). -Carry it with you and bring it out each time you have the thought, to remind yourself of the facts. Have you ever heard of the speech President Franklin Roosevelt made in 1933 about the economy? In the midst of one of the most difficult periods in the nationуs history, he said: рThe only thing we have to fear is fear itself.с Sometimes our reaction to negative events is fearful, which ends up causing more problems. For example, when the stock market crashes as it did in 1929 and 2008, people become afraid they will lose more and pull their money out of the stock market and banks. This, in turn, causes even more trouble for the economy. Similarly, our own fearful reactions to our bodyуs рfight or flightс response, its attempt to try to keep us safe, can make our anxiety much worse. In this case, the рfear of fearс is really the рfear of anxiety.с This means that we: ╔Areafraid of having anxiety symptoms ╔Believethe anxiety symptoms will be intolerable and/or last forever ╔Worry that others will notice our anxiety symptoms ╔Try to get rid of, push away, or distract from the anxiety  Earlier we discussed how anxiety can be triggered by something in the world or in our minds. Once the anxiety related to a trigger becomes severe, we begin to fear the anxiety symptoms themselves. We may try to avoid anything that makes us feel anxious, or try to protect ourselves against the anxiety. We also have negative thoughts about the anxiety itself. In the section entitled рAnxiety Fuelс we learned that our thoughts can make anxiety worse. These thoughts often sound like this: ╔   рIf that happens I will have anxiety; I wonуt be able to tolerate that.с ╔   рThis anxiety will never end.с ╔   рIf I have anxiety or a panic attack, I could have a heart attack, faint,        suffocate, go crazy, or even die.с As we discussed before, these thoughts can create a рsnowball effectс of thoughts and anxiety symptoms acting on one another, so our brain really thinks we are in danger! In CBT, we learn to step in and restructure these thoughts so they cannot continue to make our anxiety worse. рI hate this anxiety!с Have you ever tried to stop feeling anxious? How does it work? We may think that getting angry and frustrated about the anxiety may somehow get it to go away. But what is your experience? Does it go away? Typically when we try to push anxiety away, it comes back even stronger, just like scratching an itch repetitively leads to the itch getting redder, itchier, and more swollen.  Perhaps we could take a different approach: instead of pushing thoughts away, we learn to restructure them when they come up to make them less scary. This way, we donуt have to spend so much energy pushing the thoughts away, and we can feel better in case they do come. Learning not to avoid unpleasant thoughts is an important part of CBT. On the next page we learn ways to fight the рfear of fearс by learning to talk back to each of these anxiety fueling thoughts. On the following pages we outline some effective lines of evidence to use when battling these troubling thoughts.  The only thing we have to fear isи (con.) Of course, anxiety is uncomfortable, and we donуt want you to have to experience it. Sometimes, however, negative thoughts about the anxiety and the avoidance that comes with them can serve to make our anxiety much worse. Letуs look at a few common thoughts that often fuel this рfear of fear.с Here we clearly define the thought that gives us trouble and look at different рlines of evidenceс we might use to better understand the anxiety.  рIf that happens I will have anxiety; I wonуt be able to рThis anxiety will never end.с tolerate that feeling.с Line  of evidence #1: Personal experience Line of evidence #1: Past experience ╔I can think back to an event in  ╔Howmany days have I experienced anxiety in your    which I felt anxious.

Is this  realistic? Line of evidence #3: Likelihood of experiencing some pain in the future ╔Isit likely that I will experience some pain in the   future? Is it possible to prevent pain completely? ╔Isit best to try to avoid pain and discomfort completely,     or to learn to cope with pain and discomfort in order to     make it less unbearable? Just count to ten! Has anyone ever told you to рcount to tenс when you have a strong emotion, to let yourself calm down a bit? Have you ever tried it? For some of us, it seems hard to believe that just giving yourself the count of ten could help us feel better. After all, sometimes it really feels like the anxiety will never end! The truth is, our bodies are not programmed to allow anxiety to last forever. In fact, once the anxiety response is triggered, it is programmed to last only around 10 minutes. Thatуs right! So why does it seem to go on and on? As we discussed in the рAnxiety Fuelс section, the main reason this anxiety stays around is that the рfight or flightс response continues to get triggered again and again. Repetitive negative thoughts are one way this рsnowball effectс happens. However, if we do not retrigger the anxiety by thinking about it over and over or trying hard to protect ourselves, the anxiety response is programmed to turn off. So the truth is, anxiety will not last forever, if we give it a chance to shut down. This is why even just рcounting to tenс can be helpful. We can practice this technique of рemotion regulationс by reminding ourselves to рride outс the anxiety without acting on it or trying to fix it, to give it a chance to come down on its own.  As important as this is, it does not mean our only job is to learn to рride outс panic and anxiety. Over the long run we can work to reprogram our thoughts using cognitive therapy skills so the anxiety gets triggeredяand retriggeredяmuch less. The only thing we have to fear isи (con.) рWhat about this panic?!с Sometimes our рfear of fearс can reach panic proportions; our heart races, we get dizzy and lightheaded, there is pressure in the chest and the feeling of choking, racing thoughts, and a sense of dread and doom. Because these symptoms are so intense, it is understandable that one might worry that they could get worse. There are typically four рcatastrophicс predictions that we make when feeling panic. Letуs look at them more closely, one at a time. Common panic thought #1: рI will have a heart attack.с            Could I have a heart attack during a panic attack? Line of evidence #1: Personal history This is one of the most common thoughts It is easy to understand why it feels like we are having a heart attack during a people have during panic attacks; it is apanic attack, especially because the heart beats strong and hard, there is often thought that could land you in an emergency tightness in the chest, as well as feelings of dread and doom. Letуs look at this room, only to be told рyou are fineс when the prediction in more detail, in order to at least get a sense of the likelihood of medical tests come back. While many predict having a heart attack when we feel panicky. that they may have a heart attack during a ╔Howmany panic attacks have I had in the past? panic attack, we have no evidence that there ╔Howmany of these panic attacks were accompanied by  is any connection between panic attacks and  predictions that I could have a heart attack? heart attacks.

This means the chance of a  attack? heart attack occurring during your next panic attack is very, very small. Do you think it Line of evidence #2: Clinic history/research might be helpful to remind yourself of this the next time you feel some panic? Line of evidence #3: Difference between heart attacks and panic attacks ╔Arethere any differences between heart attacks and panic  attacks and how they feel? (See рIs it a heart attack, or panic,с  below) Symptoms of a heart attack and panic are very similar. Common symptoms of a heart attack are uncomfortable pressure, fullness, squeezing or pain in the center of the chest lasting more than a few minutes, and mild to intense pain spreading to the shoulders, neck or arms. It may feel like pressure, tightness, burning, or heavy weight. It may be located in the chest, upper abdomen, neck, jaw, or inside the arms or shoulders. Chest discomfort with lightheadedness, fainting, sweating, nausea or shortness of breath is also common, along with anxiety, nervousness and/or cold, sweaty skin, increased or irregular heart rate and a feeling of impending doom. Sound familiar? Many of these symptoms are the same as those listed in the рAnxiety Isис section on page 7.  One thing that separates panic from heart attacks is that panic attacks tend to improve with movement and exercise, while heart attack symptoms get worse under those conditions. Also, panic tends to reach its peak within 10 minutes and then predictably decline gradually over time. A heart attack will not get better over time. Of course it is important to be aware of potential physical problems, especially if there is a history of heart disease. But given the fact that the symptoms are so similar, we must go with our best bet, given our family history of heart disease, age, and knowledge about our heart health. The best way to solve this dilemma is to get treatment for panic; if panic is not a problem, weуll have a better idea of whether or not we are in danger of having a heart attack. The only thing we have to fear isи (con.) Common panic thought #2: рI will suffocate.с Line of evidence #1: Personal history ╔Howmany panic attacks have I had in the past? ╔Howmany of these panic attacks were accompanied by predictions  that I would suffocate? ╔HaveI ever suffocated due to a panic attack? ╔HaveI been a good predictor of suffocation in the past? Line of evidence #2: Possibility of suffocating when having panic ╔See рI canуt get enough air!с below. During a panic attack, the feeling of smothering and tightness in the chest often leads to the worry that one will not get enough oxygen and suffocate. What we find, however, is that when one is panicking, they are actually getting too much oxygen by breathing very quickly. This рover-oxygenationс is hyperventilation, which makes one feel dizzy and lightheaded. Suffocation occurs when the body does not get enough oxygen. It is highly unlikely that panic will lead to suffocation. Common panic thought #3:  рI will faint.с Line of evidence #1: Personal history ╔Howmany times have I fainted in the past? Have I been    evaluated to determine if I have a medical problem that  might lead to fainting? ╔Howmany panic attacks have I had that were associated    with fainting spells in which I actually passed out and lost  consciousness? ╔If I did pass out, how bad would it be? Would I be able to    cope in the unlikely event that I did pass out? Would it be  a catastrophe? Line of evidence #2: Compatibility between panic attacks and fainting ╔See рFainting, panic, and blood pressureс to the right. Fainting, panic, and blood pressure The idea that we might faint during a panic attack is common, because anxiety causes dizziness, lightheadedness, tunnel vision, and other strange sensations that make us feel like we are going to faint. That being said, it is very rare for a person to pass out during an anxiety attack. This is because during panic attacks and periods of high anxiety blood pressure is elevated; when we pass out, it is due to a drop in blood pressure. Some people have a type of anxiety called blood/injury/illness phobia, in which passing out is common. If you think you might have this condition, or if you have passed out multiple times in the past, discuss this with your doctor or therapist; there are ways to deal with this tricky combination of anxiety and fainting.  If you do not have a predisposition to fainting, it is highly unlikely that you will pass out during a panic attack. During a panic attack you might remind yourself that it will feel like you will pass out, but it is most likely that you will simply continue to feel dizzy and lightheaded until the panic subsides.  The only thing we have to fear isи (con.) Common panic thought #4: рI could go crazy!с Line of evidence #1: Personal history ╔Howmany panic attacks have I had in the past? ╔Howmany of these panic attacks were accompanied by predictions that I would рgo crazyс or рlose it?с ╔HaveI ever рgone crazyс or рlost itс due to a panic attack? ╔HaveI been a good predictor of рgoing crazyс in the past? Line of evidence #2: Define рgoing crazyс and рlosing it.с ╔Whatdoes this mean? Am I worried about having рcrazyс thoughts or feelings? Am I worried about doing  something рcrazy?с ╔Isthere something specific I am worried I might do (e.g. hurt myself or someone else, make a scene, etc.)? If    so, what are the chances I would actually do this? ╔Whatcan I do when I am feeling panicky to prevent any erratic and/or harmful behaviors? Line of evidence #3: Clinic history ╔Whatis my clinicianуs experience with this? How many of this clinicianуs patients have рgone crazyс or    рlost itс as a result of panic attacks? Line of evidence #4: Relationship between panic and psychosis or schizophrenia ╔See рCould I тlose it?ус below. Could I рlose it?с Often folks with extreme anxiety and panic worry that eventually they will рlose it,с and lose touch with reality or do something extreme. рLosing itс is often equated with рgoing crazyс or becoming psychotic, which means that a person loses touch with reality. So is it possible? Based on current research, there is no evidence that anxiety and panic are directly causative of disorders that include psychosis, such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. If you do not have a history of one of these illnesses, panic is not likely to lead you there. We can remind ourselves, рThis feels very uncomfortable, but I am not going crazy; this is my bodyуs attempt to protect me.с If you are worried about doing something harmful or have a history of erratic behavior during panic attacks, it may be helpful to talk to a therapist about ways to cope with these difficult feelings so we can keep ourselves and others safe. Common panic thought #5: рThis panic will hurt me in the long run.с Line of evidence #1: Pros and cons: aggressive treatment versus avoiding panic ╔Whatwill happen if I continue to avoid the sensations of panic? Will the panic get better? ╔If the panic does not get better by avoiding, is it possible that continuing to take this approach could hurt  me even more in the long run? ╔Isit better to avoid in order to feel safe now, or to accept that it will be uncomfortable now so I can feel  better in the long run? ╔See рlong term effects of anxiety,с below. Long term effects of anxiety It is true that chronic, uncontrolled anxiety causes stress on our bodies, which can make us more susceptible to illness and chronic health  conditions. One way to view this dilemma is to assess how well our methods of treating the anxiety have worked; if they have not worked, is it likely that they will work in the future? If not, we could be increasing the lifespan of the anxiety, which could cause even more stress in the long run. Addressing the anxiety through treatment, while it may cause some stress in the short term, may reduce stress in the long term. It is common to find that рshort term painс can offer us рlong term gain.с ╔Itis common to feel frustrated when we feel anxious. Our attempts to rid ourselves of the anxiety may not  work, which causes more anxiety and frustration.  ╔Often our thoughts about anxiety are negative and make the problem worse. Common thoughts related to    anxiety include worries that panic will cause a heart attack, suffocation, fainting, going crazy, or long-      term harm to the body.  ╔In the short term, it is helpful to learn to рride outс episodes of anxiety so that we do not рfuelс the anxiety.    We remind ourselves that anxiety is рuncomfortable, but not dangerous,с and that episodes of anxiety are  meant to last only about 10 minutes, if we do not trigger it again. ╔In the longer term, we use cognitive skills to address these thoughts, using lines of evidence such as  personal history and pros and cons to treat these thoughts when they come up in the course of daily life. Exercise* 1. If you have not done so already, use the techniques in the рIdentifying Negative Automatic Thoughtsс section to identify thoughts about the anxiety itself that may fuel your anxiety. 2. Use the рlines of evidenceс to examine the evidence about your anxiety.  3. Use the рExamining Thoughts Worksheetс to write down the thoughts, possible cognitive distortions, and evidence you find. 4. Remind yourself of this evidence in the morning before you start your day. When you experience anxiety during the course of the day, remember to рride outс the anxiety without reacting to it; use the рExamining Thoughts Worksheetс to remind yourself of the evidence. Remember, it takes repetition to retrain the brain! Important! Restructuring thoughts related to our рfear of fearс is just one part of our overall treatment. It may also be helpful to use these skills to address other types of thoughts, such as everyday worries and/or negative thoughts about social situations. We may also need to use behavioral skills such as exposure or relaxation skills. Most people find that a combination of methods and skills works best in managing anxiety over the long term. *If you suffer from Panic Disorder, talk to your treatment group leader or individual therapist about starting a structured CBT treatment. This treatment will combine these cognitive skills with exposure skills, among other things. Experimenting with these skills now may have some benefit, but a structured treatment is typically necessary to treat a full-blown case of Panic Disorder successfully. When we are worried, people want to reassure usя рDonуt worryис they say. Of course, just рnot worryingс is much more easily said than done! Trying to control worry can be challenging and frustrating. Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is the technical term for the condition in which we experience uncontrollable worry. One fearful thought is replaced by another. After awhile, it may seem that we worry about just about everything.  Repetitive, automatic negative thoughts (worry) about the future is the hallmark characteristic of Generalized Anxiety Disorder. The рtriggersс of anxiety are the thoughts themselves. Because thoughts are such a big part of GAD, cognitive skills are a primary component of treatment for this problem. There are two basic types of worries common in GAD. One type is worry about bad things happening to us or the people close to us. According to anxiety researchers, this is called рType Iс worry. рType IIс worry is worry about the worrying itself, which is almost always a part of GAD, and resembles the рfear of the fearс we discussed earlier. In order to treat GAD effectively, it is best to address both types of worries. Observe the examples below to clarify these important aspects of GAD. Type I Worry (Worry about bad things happening to us or people we care about) Examples: ╔рI am going to lose my job.с ╔рMy children will get sick or be hurt.с ╔рI am not going to pass this test.с ╔рOur country could be attacked by a terrorist.с ╔рI am going to end up homeless on the street.с These two types of worry, uncomfortable feelings, and our responses to the worry create a рsnowball effectс of anxiety that makes us feel worse and worse over time: Type I Worry: рI will lose my job.с Type II Worry (Worry about the worry and anxiety itself) Examples: ╔рI will never stop worrying.с ╔рI canуt tolerate this anxiety.с ╔рI must find a way to stop worrying.с ╔рIf I keep worrying like this I will eventually go crazy.с ╔рMaybethis worry will overcome me and Iуll be trapped inside of it forever.с ╔рI am causing harm to my mind and body by worrying all the time.с ╔рI hate the way this anxiety feels.с Sensitizing Behaviors: Protective efforts to avoid worrying or рfixс the worry (anxiety рfuelс) Related Type I Worry:  Physical anxiety symptoms: рI will lose my house and Muscle tension, irritability, my wife will leave me.с feeling рon edge,с trouble with sleep,  low energy, etc.  Type II Worry: рI hate this worrying.с Cognitive Skills for Daily Worry and Generalized Anxiety (con.) Below we give some examples of negative automatic thoughts common with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and outline ways to begin to restructure these thoughts, using some of the techniques we learned earlier in this module, such as рdefining terms,с using the Thought Cascade approach, and examining the evidence. Use the Examining Thoughts worksheet to record some of the facts you gather from the рlines of evidenceс below. Generalized Anxiety Disorder Example #1: рI am going to lose my job.с Step #1: Identify the potential cognitive distortions: Examples may be: рMagnificationс or         рJumping to Conclusionsс Step #2: Examine the evidence: Line of evidence #1 (likelihood): Right now, are there reasons to believe that I will lose my job? ╔Firstly, what has happened to make me believe I may lose my job? Have there been rumors going around?  Have I heard anything about my job being in jeopardy? ╔HaveI gotten any feedback from supervisors about my performance? Positive? Negative? Have there been    performance evaluations? How did I do? ╔Howlikely is it that I will lose my job? 100% likely? 50% likely? (assign a percentage to your chances) Line of evidence #2 (likelihood): My past job performance ╔HaveI ever gotten fired from a job before? If so, is there any direct evidence that I got fired because of my job performance? Are there any  other factors that may have contributed to this? What were the circumstances at the time? Do they at all differ from the circumstances now? If not, how does this fit with the idea that I am likely to get fired now? Are the circumstances now the same or different? ╔HaveI ever worried about getting fired because of my job performance before? What has happened? Have  I been a good predictor of getting fired in the past? ╔HaveI gotten feedback from supervisors in the past assessing my job performance? What were the results? Line of evidence #3: If it is likely that I will lose my job, how bad would that be? ╔If this happened, what would I do? Would I give up? Would I continue to look for jobs? ╔Arethere other possibilities? ╔Isit likely that the people closest to me would be frustrated with me and disrespect me, or are they likely to be  supportive? ╔When other people lose their job, what do you think of them?

Did I find a way to cope? How did things   turn out? Step #3: Write down the evidence gathered on a copy of the Examining Thoughts Worksheet, or list the evidence on a note card. Carry this with you and take it out when this thought occurs in your daily life. Remind yourself of the facts of the situation and then continue with your day. Step #4: Use the рThought Cascadeс approach to uncover other thoughts related to this thought, especially if you determine that it is likely that you will lose your job. Ask рIf I did lose my job, what would be bad about that? What would be the consequence?с Use the same techniques to examine the evidence around the other thoughts. Step #5: Use problem solving techniques to determine if the situation can be improved. Step #6: Use acceptance skills to let go of effort to fix things you cannot change. Cognitive Skills for Daily Worry and Generalized Anxiety (con.)                        Generalized Anxiety Disorder Example #2:               рWhat if something bad happens to one of my children?с Step #1: Phrase the thought in the form of a statement and define рsomething                     bad happens.с ╔Specify: рMy child will get hurtс or рHe will be made fun of at school,с etc. Step #2: Identify the potential cognitive distortions: ╔Examplesmay be: fortune telling, magnification. Step #3: Examine the evidence: Line of evidence #1 (likelihood): How likely is it that this will happen to my child? ╔Hassomething like this happened to my child in the past? ╔HaveI heard of this happening to children in the past?

Is there anything I can do to    improve my study habits? Could I practice taking tests to become more comfortable with the anxiety? Do I have good    test taking skills? ╔Arethere any рsafety behaviorsс or protective behaviors I am using that may actually be making we perform more  poorly on tests? For example, do I ever second guess myself repetitively about answers and change them? Do I take  more time than necessary deciding on answers? ╔Along with cognitive techniques, use exposure skills to get practice taking tests and address avoidance or    protective behaviors that may be making the anxiety worse over time.  Step #8: Use acceptance skills to let go of effort to fix things you cannot change.  For example, we do not know exactly what questions will be on every test, and it may be healthiest to accept that we may get some questions wrong. Cognitive Skills for Daily Worry and Generalized Anxiety (con.) Generalized Anxiety Disorder Example #4: рThis worry will never endс or рThis worry will make me go crazyс (Type II worry) Step #1: Identify potential cognitive distortions ╔Examplesmay be fortune telling and magnification. Step #2: Examine the evidence: Line of evidence #1: (likelihood) Past experience ╔Howhas my anxiety and worry fluctuated over the years?

Does it protect me? ╔Isit necessary for me to worry to be safe, or could I stay safe even without this anxiety? ╔HaveI ever accomplished a lot without worry? Line of evidence #2: Pros and cons of worrying to stay safe versus living with some risk ╔Whatare the good things about worrying to stay safe? What are the problems that this worrying creates in my life? ╔Whatare the good things about letting go of the worry? Are there any potential downfalls to this? ╔Do I like this worry? Do I want to continue to live with it? Would life be better without it, even if I had to accept some risks? Step #2: Identify negative automatic thoughts and examine the evidence around the specific problems happening                 at this time. Step #3: Use problem solving skills to best find a solution to a problem.  If there is no feasible solution, use                 acceptance skills to let go of attempts to control what cannot change. ╔Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is characterized by uncontrollable worry about multiple areas of oneуs life.  ╔The two types of worry are worry about bad things happening to ourselves and people close to us (type I worry) and worry about the worry itself (type II worry), both of which contribute to chronic anxiety symptoms.  ╔Worries, related worries, frustration and worry about the anxiety, attempts to fix or avoid the anxiety, and physical anxiety symptoms create the рsnowball effectс that makes the anxiety worse, both in the moment and in the long run. ╔Since thoughts are the primary рtriggersс of anxiety in GAD, cognitive therapy skills are an important part of treatment for this concern. We use рlines of evidenceс to gather facts about the situation; we look at the likelihood of bad things happening as well as ways to cope with the consequences of them happening.  ╔Problemsolving and acceptance skills are also used to address GADуs negative automatic thoughts.  Exercise 1. If you have not done so already, use the techniques in the section on рIdentifying Negative Automatic Thoughtsс about the future (type I worry), or thoughts about the worry itself (type II worry).  2. Use the examples on previous pages as a guide to ask questions about these thoughts and examine the evidence. 3. Use the рExamining Thoughtsс worksheet to write down the thoughts, possible cognitive distortions, and evidence you find. You can also write down the evidence on a note card and carry it with you. 4. Remind yourself of this evidence in the morning before you start your day. When these thoughts pop up during the course of the day, take out the рExamining Thoughtsс worksheet or the note card to remind yourself of the evidence. Remember, it takes repetition to retrain the brain! рUnifying Your Forces:с other CBT skills for Generalized Anxiety On the previous four pages there are examples of specific thoughts that occur when people worry. While thoughts are an important part of generalized anxiety, there are other factors that influence how anxious we are on a daily basis. One factor is our core beliefs and ideas about the world, called рcore schemas.с Thoughts such as рI must always give 110% to everything in my lifeс and рPeople that make less than $100,000 a year are failuresс are examples of core schemas that may be helpful to modify. Modification of core schemas are a part of CBT that could be helpful for you. There are also factors, other than the way we think, that can contribute to generalized anxiety. Examples are the goals we set (and whether or not we are reaching them) and how busy we are. Setting reasonable, achievable goals and managing our time effectively are often addressed in a course of CBT. The following are common thoughts that many people have about their own anxiety. Some of these thoughts make it hard tomove forward to address the anxiety problem assertively. Check any of the thoughts below that you may have from time-to.time. If there are others you experience that are not listed below, write them in the provided box below. Part of CBT is lookingat these thoughts, so be sure to bring them up to your therapist or group leader when you start the active phase of treatmentfollowing the group. Thoughts about anxiety being outside of oneуs control____рMy anxiety just happens, and I have no control over it.с ____рI am completely frozen by my anxiety and canуt do anything about it.с____рMy anxiety is different than everyone elseуs.с____рI canуt control my anxiety.с Pessimistic predictions about treatment____рThis anxiety will never go away.с____рI havenуt gotten better yet, so it wonуt happen.с Unrealistic expectations about the speed of improvement____рI want the anxiety to go away right now.

They are based on the idea that our thoughts can affect how we feel. We learned what cognitive therapy skills are and how they work: we gather evidence to understand a situation as realistically and in as detailed a way as possible. Cognitive Therapy Skills are not just рthinking positive.с In fact, some situations are really bad. Our goal is to Examine the Evidence and practice reminding ourselves of this evidence when we are in a challenging situation, in order to cope better with that situation. Cognitive skills are best used in combination with behavioral skills such as exposure. If we can understand how dangerous a situation is, we can make good decisions about whether or not it would improve our lives if we were to stop avoiding a situation or over-protecting ourselves, which can be limiting.  We learned how to identify Negative Automatic Thoughts and the рworst-case scenarioс thoughts that are often connected with them. Identifying Negative Automatic Thoughts is the first important step in using Cognitive Therapy Skills. We learned about Cognitive Distortions, such as рAll-or-Nothing Thinking,с which are unhelpful patterns of negative thinking. Sometimes it can be helpful to understand whether or not we have some of these patterns in order to more effectively battle our Negative Automatic Thoughts. We Examine the Evidence, using techniques to understand two important  questions: 1. How likely is it that something bad will happen? 2. If it did happen, how bad would it be? What would I do if it happened? How might I cope? The Examining Thoughts Worksheet is one tool that can help us organize the evidence we gather when we are first learning cognitive skills. Writing down evidence about a thought helps us see things more objectively and remind ourselves of information that is hard to remember when we are feeling anxious. Eventually, we hope to be able to remind ourselves of the evidence quickly in the course of daily life, without needing these types of aids. One important part of an anxiety problem is fear of the anxiety itself; because anxiety feels so bad and makes it hard to accomplish our aims, we worry about having it. We also may start wondering if the anxiety could harm us in some way; these thoughts about the anxiety can make the anxiety even worse. We dispute some of these thoughts to battle the рfear of fear.с Worries are a common part of anxiety, and we give examples of how to battle these worries using cognitive skills. рIуm going to lose my jobс and рWhat if something happens to one of my children?с are examples.   Problem solving, acceptance skills, setting achievable goals, and managing time effectively are other important factors that can reduce anxiety. We combine cognitive therapy skills, relaxation skills, and exposure skills with these other skills to manage GAD and chronic worry. рThe time to relax is when you don't have time for it.с ~Attributed to both Jim Goodwin and Sydney J. Harris Have you ever been told to рjust relax?с Of course feeling relaxed would be idealп this is why we come to get help in the first place! But anyone who has felt panic or extreme anxiety knows рjustс relaxing is much easier said than done.  One set of skills used to supplement other CBT skills (such as exposure and cognitive skills) are relaxation skills. Relaxation skills address anxiety from the standpoint of the body by reducing muscle tension, slowing down breathing, and calming the mind. Relaxation skills can be structured; examples are slow diaphragmatic breathing, meditation, and yoga. Other factors, such as self-care and enjoying pleasurable activities, are also helpful to make us feel more relaxed. In this module weуll explore some of these strategies, explaining how they are used and why they work. As we will emphasize in this section, relaxation skills are best used in conjunction with other CBT skills and are most effective when practiced consistently. Different skills work for different people, so the first step is to try to find the relaxation strategies that appeal to you and try them out. Enjoy! The Problem: рSomaticс Anxiety Symptoms Most people that experience anxiety also experience unpleasant physical sensations regularly. In medical lingo, the fancy term for рphysicalс is somatic. We all know some of the most common somatic symptoms of anxiety: muscle tension, headaches, backaches, a clenched jaw, feeling keyed up, restless, and рon edge,с as well as difficulty concentrating. You may remember that these symptoms are a side effect of our bodyуs attempts to protect us; blood moves around our body and brain, into our large muscles, like our arms, legs, back, and neck, to get us ready to сfightс or to рflee.с This changes the feelings in our bodies. In short the body is working hard to protect us, and these feelings are uncomfortable! Relaxation happens when the body stops trying to protect us, which helps us feel more calm and at ease.  When we experience mild to moderate levels of anxiety on a daily basis for long periods of time, we get used to this tense, jittery state, until it is hard to even know what it is like to be relaxed! In this case, we would say a personуs anxiety and tension is resting, or рbaseline,с at a high level. The goal of these types of relaxation exercises is to change this baseline to a lower level. Very tense Relaxation skills are like exercise! Imagine a friend of yours telling you that she is planning to train for a 10K race. Despite the fact that she has never run a race before and does not jog regularly, she tells you her training will consist singularly of practicing running the full 10 kilometers on the day before the race. What would you think about this? We know that the body needs time to learn how to run for long distances and build strength. She would need to practice at least a few times per week for a number of weeks to be ready.  Relaxation skills are developed just like exercise: in order to see significant results, we must use them regularly over long periods of time. This is not a one shot deal! With stress and worry,  levels of anxiety and tension become higher over time. The goal of relaxation strategies is to lower general levels of anxiety and tension in the body over time. Each person is different-- we all relax in different ways. In this module weуll discuss a number of different methods to try: 1. Find a relaxation exercise that you can practice daily or multiple times per week. Examples are progressive muscle relaxation, yoga, mindfulness, and deep breathing. 2. Adjust your lifestyle to make it less busy, hectic, and rushed.  3. Take part in activities that give you pleasure, make you feel competent, or give you a chance to take a break from other, more stressful activities.  Very relaxed Goals of relaxation skills 1. Learn when and how to use these skills. 2. Learn to breathe in ways that will promote calm and relaxation. 3. Slow down activity in the mind to avoid or learn to better tolerate рracing thoughts.с 4. Increase awareness of tension in the body and improve awareness of the difference between tension and relaxation. 5. Lower general levels of tension and restlessness in the body. 6. Learn to incorporate activities into our lives that are fun and/or make us feel competent. 7. Be calmer in our daily lives by learning to рslow downс and set realistic goals for our          time.  Relaxation strategies are just one set of skills used in CBT. We all would like to spend more time feeling relaxed, but relaxation skills are not always the right skills to improve our anxiety in the long run. One important CBT skill is knowing when to use certain techniques, so we want to know when relaxation strategies are or are not helpful for us. Relaxation strategies are best used as a companion to exposure and cognitive skills, but not as a replacement to them. Sometimes relaxation strategies can actually make anxiety worse in the long run. Why? Because sometimes relaxation strategies are used as a way to get rid of anxiety when we are in distress; trying to get rid of something trains our brains to see it as рbad.с So we teach the brain to set off the anxiety рalarmс even louder when the anxiety presents itself. In the long run, this makes the anxiety worse. In short, there are times and places for relaxation skills! When to use relaxation strategies -As a daily practice, like exercise, to lower tension and feel calmer in our bodies over time -During times of distress in order to prevent avoidance of something that is integral to our life aims      Why? It is more assertive: рDoing this exercise will      not cure my anxiety, but it will keep me from      avoiding the situation.с рHow should I relax?       (When we face the anxiety, the brain learns that      it is not so dangerous, which, in turn, lowers the What will work for me?с      anxiety in the long run) Everyone is differentя some relaxation skills work well for When not to use relaxation strategies some people, and others for other people. It is likely that there are some methods that you already use to relax.

On one hand this is helpful to just slow down and cool off. However, altering the speed of our breath actually can slightly change our bodyуs anxiety response. Slow diaphragmatic breathing is a developed technique that involves slowing down the breath to communicate рsafetyс to the brain.   While we do not recommend that you use breathing techniques to try to eliminate anxiety when you are feeling anxious, it can be a way to get through a tough situation and calm the body some so that we can make a good decision about what to do next. Try the following exercise: рSlow Diaphragmatic Breathingс 1. Sit comfortably in a chair with your feet on the floor. You can lie down if you wish. 2. Fold your hands on your belly. 3. Breathe in slowly and calmly. Fill up the belly with a normal breath. Try not to breathe in too heavily. The hands should move up when you breathe in, as if you are filling up a balloon. Avoid lifting the shoulders as you inhale; rather, breathe into the stomach. 4. Breathe out slowly to the count of р5.с Try to slow down the rate of the exhale. After the exhale, hold for 2-3 seconds before inhaling again. 5. Work to continue to slow down the pace of the breath. 6. Practice this for about 10 minutes. 7. This works best if you practice this two times each day for 10 minutes each time. Try to find a regular time to practice this each day. Slow Diaphragmatic Breathing Tips: 1. The speed of the breath is more important than the depth of the breath. Avoid trying to рcatchс your breath by taking really deep breaths. 2. Donуt use breathing exercises to рget rid ofс the anxiety; use the breath to help get you through a tough situation, or practice it daily to рtrain inс a slower, calmer breathing style over time. 3. Practice! It takes time to learn how to calm the body using the breath. Take home points: Slow diaphragmatic breathing is one relaxation skill used in CBT. It is best used as a daily practice, like exercise, or as a way to get through a tough situation without leaving or making things worse. For best results, practice slow breathing twice a day for around 10 minutes each time. Take a moment to observe the photo to the right and then try this exercise: Just describe what you see in completely objective terms. Just notice colors, shapes, shades, etc. Write what you see here: Now notice the memories and thoughts that come up when you look at this picture. Allow your mind to wander as it will, and write down what рpopsс into your mind as it comes up. Take 1-2 minutes to do this. The techniques you were just using are called mindfulness skills. These are techniques that originate in Buddhist meditation practices, but they have been studied and used more and more by psychologists and physicians in the last 20 years or so to help people regulate their emotions and calm their minds. So how do they work? It is not fully understood why mindfulness is so helpful, but we have some ideas. The goal of mindfulness is to describe all kinds of experiences objectively and non-judgmentally, focusing on the facts about the present moment. Sound familiar? It may remind you of cognitive skills, which are an attempt to gather evidence around a thought that triggers our anxiety, which lessens the power of that thought. Another way to lessen the power of the thought is to see it for what it is: just a thought. And one thing we know about thoughts is that they change. It is difficult to adequately capture the gist of mindfulness by trying to explain it, so try the exercise to the right. Mindfulness Exercise 1. Sit quietly with your feet on the floor, or lie down, and relax your body. Begin with some slow, diaphragmatic breathing. Focus your mind on your breath as it flows in and out of your nostrils. Continue to follow your breath to whatever extent you can. 2. As you breathe, notice the tendency of the mind to wander. Instead of trying to focus just on the breath, just notice what the mind does. It may wander to a worry, or a memory, or to what you plan to do later today. You may notice sensations in your body, such as a pain or itch. You may hear or smell things. Just notice whatever happens and then gently bring yourself back to your breath. You can remind yourself that you will tend to these other things later, and for now you will just spend time paying attention to your breath and to your mind. 3. Allow the mind to wander as it will, time after time. Avoid the tendency to try hard to focus on something. Simply allow your mind to wander and then bring yourself back to your breath. Notice the tendency of your experience to change. Imagine that each thought, sensation, emotionяanythingя is like a cloud floating through the sky, soon to be replaced by another one.  4. Continue to practice this for about 10 minutes. Depending on your schedule you can add time to your practice if you want. Practice once or twice a day. 5. Remember that there is no рrightс way to do this, other than to just notice whatever comes into your consciousness. It is impossible to рfailс at mindfulnessяjust let your mind wander! Slow down the mind, con рI canуt control my mind!с On the last page we suggested that you рlet your mind wander.с This may seem to be the opposite of what you have been told to do while trying to meditate or complete a task. We go into something expecting to have рcontrolс of our minds. We know from research that we cannot completely рcontrolс our minds, no matter how hard we try, especially when we are feeling anxious. Why do you think this is true? Think back to the рAnxiety 101с section of this manual where we described the function of anxiety to help protect us. When we are anxious, the amygdala, our anxiety center of the brain is trying to send off its рanxiety alarm.с One way it does this is by trying to alert us to the possibility that something is dangerous, either рout thereс in the environment or inside our bodies. After all, if we are too focused on one thing, we could be hurt by something else! So the mind tries to distract us, making it very difficult to рcontrolс the mind. In fact, you may find that the more you try to control it, the more the mind tries to distract you!  Having trouble getting рmindful?с Try this: pretend your mind is like a movie screen. You are sitting in the movie theater, observing what is projected on the screen, but you are not in control; you just watch and follow what you see.  Try closing your eyes and just notice what images, thoughts, or memories get projected on that screen. They may be related or notяwhatever gets projected is fair game! If you start feeling attached to the content of the рmovie,с just notice that attachment and then let the movie continue to something else.        рWhy should I practice mindfulness?с Mindfulness techniques are an important part of CBT for the following reasons: -Trying to рcontrolс the mind is a futile endeavor. In fact, trying to control the mind often makes us feel worse, because we keep failing at it! The first step to any CBT intervention is to stop trying to control the mind through force; only after we do this are we prepared to influence the anxiety using CBT skills.  -Mindfulness helps us practice observing but not reacting to anxiety and other emotions. We learn to accept or tolerate these emotions, rather than trying to eradicate them. -Mindfulness helps to retrain the brain; by not reacting to the anxiety and not trying to fix it, we communicate to the amygdala that it is not dangerous. This is one way to work on addressing the рfear of fear.с -When we stop and pay attention to the present moment, we listen to our anxiety рalarm.с If we give it time and keep from рfuelingс the anxiety, the body can eventually learn that it does not need this alarm any longer, so it can turn it off.  Mindfulness: Take Home Points Mindfulness is a relaxation strategy that can be helpful in calming the mind by reducing our tendency to try to control it, which often makes the anxiety worse. Mindfulness techniques focus on facts and objective information about current experiences, including emotions, thoughts, memories, and sensations. Our aim is to notice these experiences without judgment or any attempt to change them; we simply observe them, like clouds in the sky or the images on a movie screen. Mindfulness techniques are not likely to cure anxiety all by themselves, but they can be helpful if used with other CBT skills, and can provide a foundation upon which to develop these skills. One way to think about relaxation is that it is the absence of tension in the bodyуs muscles. Imagine being able to simply release your bodyуs tension instantly without taking medication or having a drink! In the 1920уs Edmund Jacobson, a Chicago physician, created a set of exercises aimed to do just thatя he published his intervention in a book entitled Progressive Relaxation. What Jacobson knew to be true is that deep muscle relaxation is incompatible with our bodyуs anxiety response. He worked with the knowledge that by consciously working to reduce muscle tension, we can actually influence how anxious we feel. The aim of what we now call Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) is to gradually learn to release tension in the muscles through daily exercises. This communicates calm and safety to our body, reducing the bodyуs need to activate the рfight or flightс response.  Exercise To get a taste of this, try tensing the muscles of the arms by рflexingс your biceps, as in the picture to the right. Tense your biceps hard enough to feel significant tension for between 5 and 7 seconds. Now let go, dropping your arm to your side. Feel the difference between the tension you just felt and the relaxation that is coming over your arm now. You may notice the feeling of blood flowing to the arm, and a feeling of warmth. PMR involves doing this with each group of muscles in the body, as a regularly practiced exercise that takes effect over a period of time.  To get a full рdoseс of Progressive Muscle Relaxation, try the track рProgressive Muscular Relaxationс on the Anxiety Disorders Program Website. This will take you about 16 minutes. This track will help you relax the body, one muscle group at a time. It is best to try to practice this for two weeks, once or twice a day. Some people find that it is helpful to do it in the morning when they wake up, or at night before going to bed. After you try this, you can decide if you want to continue with Applied Relaxation, which is the program described on the next page. This program builds on what we have learned from Progressive Muscle Relaxation by helping us to learn to relax more and more quickly.  Progressive Muscle Relaxation: Take Home Points Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) is a set of exercises aimed at helping us reduce anxiety and tension in the body. Through the practice of tensing and relaxing groups of muscles, we learn to feel the difference between tension and relaxation and release muscle tension when we feel it. It works best if practiced regularly. As with any skill, relaxation takes time and practice to master. Applied Relaxation (see the next page) builds on the skills learned in PMR to more quickly reach a relaxed state, even under stressful circumstances.  For more information about Progressive Muscle Relaxation and Applied Relaxation, refer to Davis, Robbins, and McKayуs Relaxation and Stress Reduction Workbook, which has written scripts for these techniques. Progressive Muscle Relaxation, con. Applied Relaxation The Swedish physician L.G. ┘st took the principles of Progressive Muscle Relaxation and developed Applied Relaxation, a program that aims to increase our ability to relax quickly, even in stressful circumstances. This is a set of skills that takes time to developяas you can see from the outline of the stages below, each of the stages of treatment involves one to two weeks of practice. Full scripts of this program are available in Davis, Robbins, and McKayуs Relaxation and Stress Reduction Workbook. 1A: Progressive Muscle Relaxation Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) is the basic skill (this is discussed further on the previous page). While guided by a therapist (or recording), a person practices tensing and then relaxing individual muscle groups, which releases tension and makes one more aware of the difference between tension and relaxation. It is good to practice in the morning or at night before going to bed. Try practicing it one or two times per day for two weeks before expecting to see results. 6. Applied Relaxation This final stage uses the same techniques used in Stage 5, now applied to more stressful situations, including those that involve some degree of anxiety.  5. Rapid Relaxation Rapid Relaxation allows us to bring the time to relaxation down to 20-30 seconds. We learn to pick something in our daily life with which we have contact regularly, such as a clock or watch, and associate this cue to the relaxation we have learned in the previous stages. Some people find it helpful to put a piece of colored tape on whatever cue they pick. It works best if we can practice this 15-20 times a day in normal, non-stressful situations.   You will know when you are ready to move on to the next step when you can bring a sense of relaxation to the body within 20-30 seconds. Applied Relaxation Stage 1A: Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) (Track One): 2x per day in 18 minute increments for 2 weeks. Stage 1A: PMR Shorthand Procedure (Track Two): 2x per day in 7-8 minute increments for 2 weeks. Stage 2: Release-Only Relaxation (Track Three): 2x per day in 5-7 minute increments for 1-2 weeks.  Stage 3: Cue-Controlled Relaxation (Track Four): 2x per day in 2-3 minute increments for 1-2 weeks. Stage 4: Differential Relaxation (Tracks Five and Six): 2x per day in 10 minute increments Stage 5: Rapid Relaxation (Track Seven): Practiced multiple times a day in the flow of daily life.  Stage 6: Applied Relaxation (Track 8): Here the goal is to learn to relax quickly under actual stressful circumstances. 1B: Progressive Muscle Relaxation: рShorthand Procedureс Once a person has mastered the basics of Progressive Muscle Relaxation, we can begin to learn to reach this relaxed state more quickly, by tensing and relaxing larger groups of muscles at one time. This shortens the time to do the exercises to 8 to 9 minutes.  2: Release-Only Relaxation In this phase of Applied Relaxation treatment, we take out the рtensingс step, to learn to release muscles and feel relaxed even more quickly-- in around 5-7 minutes. 3: Cue-Controlled Relaxation Cue-Controlled Relaxation reduces the amount of time to deep relaxation. We learn to be able to relax whenever we choose, for example, when we say the word рrelax.с It is possible to reduce the time to relaxation to around 2-3 minutes in most cases. 4. Differential Relaxation The goal of Differential Relaxation is to help one learn to relax in the midst of daily activities. Most daily activities involve use of some muscles but not others. In this step we learn to isolate the muscles we need for a specific task and relax the rest of our body. In this way we can learn to incorporate relaxation into the flow of daily life. Imagine that you are at a supermarket shopping for breakfast cereal. So many choices! Some people like a simple granola, others enjoy their cereal sweet, and others like something with fruit in it. You might choose something youуve enjoyed before, or you might try something new because it looks like it would be tasty or nutritious. When it comes to relaxation strategies, there are many options. We have to find the ones that work for us. So far weуve introduced three available рbrandsс of relaxation: breathing, mindfulness, and Progressive Muscle Relaxation.  You may have listed some relaxation strategies that work for you in the section: рRelaxation Strategies: When? How? Why?с Below we list a number of other popular, formal relaxation strategies that have been used successfully by others. You might try some and add them to your list! рSoothingс Activities рMind-basedс Relaxation Strategies ╔Sounds:music you enjoy; ambient music; ╔Meditation (Mindfulness meditation,с рnew age,с repetitive music; sounds of  nature, Transcendental Meditation, etc.)   such as babbling brooks or ocean waves ╔рBody Scanс/body awareness exercises ╔Smells(Aromatherapy): incense, candles, etc. ╔Prayer ╔Sights: Visualization: beaches, falling leaves, etc. ╔Autogenics ╔Nature:hiking, swimming, parks, etc. рBody-basedс Relaxation Strategies ╔Slow-paceddiaphragmatic breathing ╔Yoga ╔ProgressiveMuscle Relaxation and Applied  Relaxation ╔Massage ╔Hottubs, hot baths, or sauna Did you know? Yoga is a well-established, historic discipline that incorporates a powerful combination of mental and physical elements: breathing, stretching, meditation, and strengthening exercises, aimed at improving physical and mental well-being. It involves a series of challenging body positions that stretch and strengthen muscles. It is best learned by taking a class with a certified yoga instructor, and has many benefits, both physical and mental. On this page we introduced some of the structured approaches to relaxation that have been used successfully by others over the years. However, some of the most relaxing activities are those that we enjoy, or make us feel good because we are good at them and can be creative or skillful. On the next page we discuss mastery and pleasure, two important elements of living a relaxing and enjoyable life. A Life Worth Living: Pleasure and Mastery If someone were to ask you рWhat do you do to relax?с it is likely that you would say something like рI like to hang out with friends,с рI watch TV,с or рI play golf.с While these are not formal relaxation strategies, they bring us pleasure and/or make us feel good about ourselves; we certainly feel more relaxed when that is the case. These are the things that the anxiety tries to take away from us, which is even more of a reason to spend time doing them! For the purpose of exploration here, we outline two important generators of good feelings: pleasure and mastery. Pleasure involves activities, or рplayс that we enjoy for the sake of the activity itself. Mastery involves activities, such as work or sports, that involve the development of skills; we are able to accomplish things and feel a sense of mastery over our environment. When enjoyed in moderation and diversified well with other activities, they can increase positive emotions and improve how we feel about ourselves. рPleasureс Hobbies and other рplayс ╔    Reading ╔ TV, movies, plays ╔    Dancing ╔    Playing or listening to         music ╔    Board games or cards ╔ Arts and crafts, sewing, painting ╔    Cooking ╔ Walking, hiking, enjoying nature,         fishing ╔    Sports (basketball, softball,        swimming, etc.) or going as a      spectator ╔    Martial arts (karate, etc.) ╔    Museums/zoos ╔ Video games ╔ Traveling, sightseeing, going           to the beach, sunbathing ╔    Shopping ╔    Gardening/decorating ╔    Photography ╔    Comedy: TV, recordings, live ╔    Religion or spirituality List enjoyable activities in which you take part now or have enjoyed in the past.

CBT supplies us with some of the ammunition to wage this battle, but other lifestyle factors are important. as well. Below we discuss some of these factors; consider them when assessing your challenges with anxiety and consider trying out some changes to see if they help. Moderate and Balance Coping Skills Address anxiety from a variety of different angles by confronting fear, problem solving,     accepting that which cannot be controlled, and modifying thinking when necessary. Take care of the body and        mind, addressing the important elements of self-care listed below. Remember that рdiversityс is the cardinal Diet                    rule when it comes to coping with challenges; the more skills  and coping methods we have,                                                        the more flexible we can be when  challenges arise. Avoid or limit use of рmind altering drugsс      Be aware that all drugs that alter state of mind such as alcohol, caffeine, nicotine, mari.juana, other illicit drugs, can exacerbate an-    xiety in both the short and long term. Discuss    your use of these substances openly with a         prescribing clinician to understand                 better your own risk factors. Sleep            Research has shown that most     people need an average of about 7 hours        of sleep per night. Sleeping well is an     important aspect of managing anxiety. Talk to         your doctor or therapist about a referral      for a consultation with a sleep expert if                  you suffer from insomnia or                                sleep apnea.  рSlow downс Ask yourself: рHas        there been a day this week       in which I did not рrushс at      all?  Keeping a constant fast  pace in activity, whether walking,  working, or even planning leisure activities, communicates a sense of  urgency to the brain, raising blood   pressure and tension in the body.  This has an impact on our anxiety           from day-to-day. Practice     рslowing downс your pace of           life consciously to reduce                    this sense of                         urgency. Treat Mental Illness              Learn to manage anxiety using                 CBT skills. Treat other forms of        mental illness if they interfere with your           life. If the therapy you try does not seem       to be working, try another therapy style        or therapist. Consider a рcombination             therapy,с which combines a assort- ment of therapy skills, medi- cation, and self-care.   Exercise              Regular exercise has been                    shown to be as good as     antidepressant medication for treating   depression and increases our resistance to    debilitating anxiety. Try to get a minimum    of 20 minutes of vigorous cardiovascular      exercise at least three times a week. Of           course, be sure to ask your doctor              if you are healthy enough for                   more intensive exercise. Time Management            Set realistic goals about what can be     accomplished in a certain amount of time.  Avoid multi-tasking excessively. Plan your day      with enough time left over to sleep enough,   exercise, and enjoy a leisure activity. If you feel           that you have trouble managing your                 time, discuss it with a therapist                             or life coach.                     Eating a balanced diet                helps us maintain health,              improves energy, and contributes            to good mood. Be aware of the       quality of your food, as well as how           much you eat; eating either too                 much or too little can affect                     how you feel on a                            daily basis. Confront Conflict         Do not allow interpersonal   conflicts to fester; learn assertive-        ness and other communication            skills and address conflict                  proactively and                        diplomatically. Goal Setting Set realistic goals in line with your           life aims. Strive for balance of        meaningful work, interpersonal (family        and friends), and enjoyment-oriented         goals. Remember to take one  small            step at a time to reach larger                                goals. Treat Physical Illness       Scientific research shows a connection     between physical health, mood, and anxiety.       Learn about your family medical history,          go to the doctor as needed, and take                  prescribed medications. Social Support When we feel supported            by others, we feel more safe,       secure, and happy. One important      approach to treating anxiety is to        reduce symptoms; another way is      to increase positive experiences,       especially with people  that help                   us feel good about                        ourselves.  Use the following worksheet and design your own relaxation plan to begin incorporating relaxation skills into your daily life. Be specific and come up with as many choices as you can imagineя remember that not all strategies will рstick,с but in time you can find the ones that feel best to you. The only thing left to do is give them a try!  My Relaxation Plan (how I plan to incorporate relaxation into my daily life) Formal relaxation exercises (Progressive Muscle Relaxation, Mindfulness, Slow Diaphragmatic Breathing, Yoga): ____________________________________________________________________________________________           How often (days per week, time of day, etc.):___________________________________________________ Pleasure and Mastery (activities I enjoy, socializing, things I am good at): _______________________________ Self-care (see the section on рSelf-careс and write down examples that would improve your life): _____________ Other soothing activities: ______________________________________________________________________ Are there any aspects of my lifestyle (time management, too many projects, etc.) that increase my level of tension and anxiety on a daily basis? What could be modified? _______________________________________________________________________ How would my life improve if I incorporated some of the elements above into my daily life? What is one thing I can do today or tomorrow to make a small step toward more relaxation in my daily life? Relaxation strategies battle anxiety from the standpoint of the body. They are just one set of exercises used in CBT. We discussed what relaxation strategies are and how we can use them to help us battle anxiety symptoms. We learned that relaxation strategies work best if they are practiced over the long term, like exercise, to reduce muscle tension, slow down the pace of breathing, and рslow down the mind.с Relaxation strategies are not ultimately helpful as a way to reduce severe anxiety symptoms, such as panic, when these symptoms arise. Relaxation skills are used in combination with the cognitive and behavioral skills discussed throughout this manual. Cognitive therapy and exposure skills work to retrain the brain to have fewer anxiety triggers. Relaxation exercises are not very effective at рretrainingс these triggers, which is why they are not typically enough on their own to teach the brain that it can let the рguardс down. We discuss breathing skills. The most important element of breathing is slowing down the pace of the breath, which takes practice, especially if anxiety is in the picture. We introduced mindfulness skills, which are techniques that aim to рslow down the mind.с We learn to see thoughts and feelings for what they areя thoughts and feelingsяthat come in and out of our awareness. By allowing them to come and go without trying to рfixс them, we communicate less urgency and more рcalmс to the body. Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) involves tensing and relaxing groups of muscles to learn to better understand the difference between tension and relaxation. Through a program called Applied Relaxation, we can learn to do this more and more quickly with practice. There are many formal relaxation strategies, and each person may find something different that works for them. The important thing is to find the strategies that work for you and practice them consistently over time. Some of the most relaxing activities are those that involve things we enjoy or are good at. рPleasureс and рmasteryс feel good, so doing more of these things can only help! The anxiety often gets in the way of some of these things, but avoiding pleasurable activities is likely to make things worse. It is important to incorporate some of these activities into our daily lives on a regular basis. Finally, we review important elements of self-care, such as exercise, diet, and time management. It is difficult, for example, to feel relaxed when we do not get enough sleep or are too busy. Slowing down the pace of life and taking care of our bodies can help us feel more relaxed from day-to-day.    So now what? So far we have discussed many of the skills used in CBT. Our final step is to learn how to put them all together and manage anxiety over the long term. Thatуs what the next section, рAnxiety Management,с is all about. Weуll also learn about the CBT treatment options that we offer here at U of M. Itуs time to take your life back from anxiety by formally starting your CBT treatment! рCourage is resistance to fear, mastery of fearяnot absence of fear.с~Mark Twain Now that weуve learned about many of the skills youуll see in CBT, letуs talk about how to put them all together. This section uses the analogy of a рtug of warс to describe our battle with anxiety and stress over time. The information in this section helps us approach treatment of anxiety in a realistic, effective way. This especially applies to treatment of anxiety over long periods of timeяperiods in which it is inevitable that we will experience stress of some sort or another.  We talk about the balance between risk and protection that underlies each decision we make, and how these decisions make us more or less vulnerable to anxiety. We also spend time in this section discussing what рcausesс anxiety, the risk factors that make us more vulnerable to it, including genetics and stress.  We briefly discuss some рotherс CBT skills for anxiety, problem solving and acceptance skills. At the end of this section we also describe the CBT treatment options available to you at the University of Michigan Anxiety Disorders Clinic to help you with the next steps in your journey to free yourself from anxiety. Think back to the last time you had a рtug of warс at a fair or on the beach. Your team has some influence on the outcome; but the other team may (or may notи) make things hard for you to achieve your aim.  Managing anxiety over the long term can sometimes feel like a рtug of war.с Despite our attempts at creating a happy, comfortable life, there is always the possibility that some рexternal stressor,с like an accident, job loss, or interpersonal conflict, could arise. One important goal of CBT skills is to give us confidence that we can cope with these unexpected stressors when they happen.  The opponent in a game of рtug of warс is as integral to the game as stress is to our lives. And just as it is in the game, we can only win if we participate. Participation in the game of life means accepting stress and finding ways to manage it to achieve our life aims. The diagram below may help you to understand how to use CBT skills to assist you in your рtug of warс with stress. To the left are stressors that are often outside of our control; on the right are the coping skills we need to keep the anxiety from interfering with our life aims.  рTug of War,с continued Another way to look at our battle with stress and anxiety is to try to balance a normal desire for protection with a hope of achieving certain life aims. This may seem like an abstract concept, so letуs look at some specific examples of balancing risk with life aims. Should I take the chance? Orи How often do you drive or ride as a passenger in a car? Probably every day! Automobiles have changed how we live our lives; they are convenient and help us achieve our life aims quickly and efficiently. It is hard to imagine living without them. Of course, driving or riding in a car involves some risk. According to the United States Department of Transportation, there is a 1 in 84 chance of being killed in an automobile accident at some point in our lives. So why do we take this risk? It must be worth it to take this chance. We take the small risk of getting into an accident in order to take advantage of the benefits automobile travel can afford us. Of course, the fact that it is relatively unlikely certainly helps!  Every day we take risks to reach our life aims. While we probably arenуt noticing this process, we have рpros and consс playing in our head about most decisions we make. Check out the example below: Pros and Cons: Driving or riding in a car! рConsс 1. Small chance of getting hurt or killed in an ! accident! 1.Costs associated with driving (gas, repairs, ! etc.)! рProsс 1. Get to destination faster! 2. Accomplish more of my goals each day: work, ! daily chores, fun and hobbies, etc.! 3. Increase number of activities that are available to ! me! As the above example illustrates, our lives are filled with decisions about when to take risks and when to protect ourselves. Usually we are trying to find a balance between protection and risk. We try to have as much as we can without increasing the chance of harm too much. There are many options. Below, we illustrate this continuum and decisions we make that move us more toward risk (and more freedom) or protection (and less freedom). It is our choice to decide how much risk to take most people try to find a reasonable balance between risk and protection. Drive with рreasonable safety behaviorsс in place (balance between risk and protection: - Drive safely: moderate speeds,               drive with the flow of traffic, etc.           -No multitasking while driving          -Keep car in good repair          -Take defensive driving classes         -Be careful when there is bad               weather рThese are the things I enjoy and I wonуt let anxiety take them from me. It is worth taking that small chanceto have some of the things I want.с! Greater risks, fewer precautions, more freedom, better quality of life Drive with no concern for safety at all (too much risk): рThere is no risk here; nothing bad could happen to me. I donуt need to be careful.с! No driving at all (complete protection): рIt is best to be safe and prevent bad things from happening at all costs.с! рI would rather not do that if it is going to make me feel anxious.с ! рI want to take all precautions to be sure that everything will be OK.с! рTug of War,с continued Nature or nurture? Revisitedи In the рAnxiety 101с section of this manual we briefly discussed the causes of anxiety. While there are many factors that lead to an anxiety problem, we know that our vulnerability to anxiety is related to both рnatureс and рnurture.с Nature is what we inherit from our parents: our genetics. Nurture is life experiences. Risk factors (genetics or experiences that make one more рat riskс for developing anxiety) are a mixture of these two basic elements. Below we list some of the most common risk factors for anxiety. рNatureс and рNurtureс Early life experience: Patterns of attachment with parents, early life stress, traumatic experiences early in life, etc. Modeling from important elders/ authority figures: Genetics: inherited learned protective behaviors, ideas about vulnerability to what is/is not dangerous, etc. physical and/or mental illness Traumatic experiences: accidents, assault, deaths of loved ones, near death experiences, being attacked by an animal, etc. Learned patterns of cognitive inflexibility (rigid thinking), such as extreme criticality or perfectionism рI Want Control!с Patterns of uncertainty in treatment by others: Most of us work hard to maintain some control over our Abuse or neglect during upbringing, moving frequently from area to area, lives: we plan, protect, and organize our lives so they are unpredictable parenting more predictable and feel safer. While there are some things in our lives that we can successfully control, there are other things that we cannot. In fact, we may find that the more we try to control some things, the more this control eludes us.  One thing that is very hard to control completely is our body; sometimes it seems as if we experience a constant influx of pain, anxiety, emotion, and thought. The truth about these automatic impulses is that we cannot completely control them, no matter how hard we try. Once a thought comes into our head, it is there; once an emotion happens, it happens. As we have learned at times earlier in this manual, trying to get rid of thoughts and feelings often makes them last longer or grow in intensity. However, our responses to these impulses can influence how we experience the anxiety in the future. We use skills learned in CBT to influence the anxiety in this way. It is for this reason that in CBT we frame anxiety management as an effort to influence the anxiety, through skills and adaptive responses to it, rather than to рcontrolс it. Complete control is impossible, but at the least we can manage the symptoms of anxiety, which are likely to come up from time to time. Look at the quotations below to further understand this difference. Influence рWhile my decisions have a part to play in how thingsturn out, there are some things out of my control.с! рI canуt prevent thoughts and feelings from happening,but my responses to these impulses can influence howI experience the anxiety in the future.с! рLearning to cope with hardships is a part of life.

One important goal of CBT is to understand our vulnerability to anxiety and use coping skills to offset this vulnerability.  We all have to find our own balance of рriskс versus рprotectionс to achieve our life aims. While we all would like to be completely safe, there is always some risk in each decision we make. With CBT we learn what risks are worth taking to reach our aims.  When a problem arises, there many possible responses. As we have discussed throughout this manual, some responses to anxiety and problems can help to solve these problems; others can serve to make things worse. Below we describe three ways of addressing a problem. One approach may work best, or all three may apply. The рtake home pointс here is that all situations are different, and require different types of approaches to help you meet your life aims.  Adaptive Response #1: Problem solving (actions/behaviors) Sometimes the best answer to a problem is working to рsolveс the problem somehow How to take яit is not a problem with our thinking or behavior, it is a problem with the external action to solve a circumstances. For example, if someone is consistently aggressive or abusive of us, problem we may want to find a way to set firm limits with that person or leave the relationship altogether. There are many problem solving skills, some of which are outlined below: -Exposure skills to address avoidance 1.

Sometimes letting go of things we cannot control is necessary to prevent problems from getting even worse; we also lift some of the burden of failing over and over. How do I know what to do to make it better? Sometimes it is difficult to know which approach to take to make a situation better. While it is ultimately an individual decision, one that may take trial and error, therapy is a place to work out some of these difficult choices. The various skills in CBT are meant to help us get some clarity around some of these decisions. While we donуt have room in this manual to discuss in detail how to make these decisions, this is something to discuss with your group or individual therapist as you move through treatment. Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy is an effective, evidence-based treatment that has been proven to have an impact on anxiety in both the short and long term. Our clinic specializes in delivery of this intervention to people like you, who want anxiety to stop interfering with their lives. Below we explain some of what to expect from CBT treatment.  Cognitive Behavioral Therapyи иis regular. It works best when you come to treatment once per week for most of the treatment course. It is common to go to once every other week or once a month once the symptoms have been reduced and you have entered the рmaintenanceс period of treatment.   иtypically lasts for between 12 and 16 sessions. Depending on the problem, it may take more or less. This is not a treatment that is meant to last for significant amounts of time.  иis structured. This is not the style of therapy in which one comes into the session only to рventс or have someone with whom to talk. The treatment is focused specifically on treatment aims, which usually include reducing the impact of anxiety on our lives and feeling better, by learning skills and techniques to respond to anxiety when it arises.  иhas a variety of skills. As you may have noticed from this manual, there are different ways to manage an anxiety problem. Most people find it helpful to use a variety of skills, instead of searching for just one рsilver bullet.с There is most likely not just one answer to your anxiety problem. However, the anxiety symptoms can usually be managed well if one practices multiple skills repetitively over time and incorporates them into the flow of daily life. иrequires practice. Call it homework, daily practice, or whatever you choose. Regardless, it takes daily repetition to learn skills and retrain oneуs anxiety response. A rule of thumb is to expect to spend about one hour a day practicing CBT in between sessions.

The most important factor in whether or not treatment works is the amount of work you put into it. Consider it an investment in a future with more freedom and flexibility.  иis collaborative. Individual and group CBT are structured, but are also centered around your life aims. The patient and therapist work together to define treatment targets, adapt skills to the patientуs unique circumstances, and troubleshoot as barriers arise. If certain skills do not work, it is common to try others. If something does not seem to be working, one can discuss this with the therapist or group leader. Communication is an important part of CBT. иis evidence-based. This means that the concepts and skills are based on scientifically-validated concepts, and the interventions have been tested to be sure they are helpful. On the next page we discuss the different treatment options at this clinic to continue with CBT once you finish the basic group.  CBT Treatment in the University of Michigan Anxiety Disorders Clinic, con. What do I do after the CBT Basic Group for Anxiety? Option 1: Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy Treatment Groups A popular option for the next step in treatment is our CBT Treatment Groups, which takes the skills we discussed in the Basic Group one step further. These groups focus on the two main skill sets of CBT, Exposure and Desensitization and Cognitive Therapy Skills. Individuals that take part in these groups are asked to share with the group their treatment targets and anxiety triggers, while designing cognitive and behavioral interventions to address specific problems. Patients are expected to practice skills in between sessions.  Each group meets for one month of weekly sessions at a time, and the two groups alternate months. For example, the Exposure group may meet in January for four sessions, and the Cognitive Therapy Skills group meets in February for the same amount. This pattern repeats. If a patient wishes to take part in both groups they may, and they are encouraged to repeat groups to get more experience and practice with CBT skills. The Exposure and Desensitization groups are ideal for patients with panic disorder, agoraphobia, social anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and specific phobias. Patients with generalized anxiety disorder are encouraged to attend this group, but may find the most benefit from the Cognitive Therapy Skills group.  The Cognitive Therapy Skills group is ideal for chronic worry, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety, panic disorder, and specific phobias. Patients with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) may find this group helpful, but the primary mode of treatment for OCD is exposure.  Patients with a primary diagnosis of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) are encouraged to pursue individual therapy, which typically involves an exposure-based mode of treatment called Prolonged Exposure for PTSD. Talk to your referring clinician or group leader about this option if you are interested.  Option 2: Individual Cognitive Behavioral Therapy If treatment groups are not the best option for you, another option is individual therapy. Individual CBT therapy is recommended if you cannot attend the CBT Treatment Groups due to a schedule conflict. Also, some anxiety problems are best treated in individual therapy. If you have a question about whether to attend groups or individual therapy, talk to your CBT Basic Group leader or the clinician that referred you to the group. If it is determined that individual therapy would be most helpful for you, we will discuss your case in the Anxiety Team Meeting on the following Monday and get back to you with our recommendations and referral options.  Option 3: Some other form of psychotherapy CBT is not for everyone. If after you complete this group you realize that you are not interested in group or individual CBT, talk to your referring clinician about other therapy options. Some of these options include group and individual therapy aimed at addressing such problems as relationship issues, depression, and Bipolar Disorder. Whatever your problem, the best option is to discuss what you are looking for with the clinician that worked with you at your initial evaluation. You can also ask your Basic Group Leader for advice about this. For some, we recommend a one-session рtherapy evaluationс with an experienced clinician to help make decisions about the next steps in treatment with us. Option 4: Individual therapy evaluation For some, especially anyone that is confused about which direction to go with their treatment, we recommend a one-session рtherapy evaluationс with an experienced clinician to help make decisions about the next steps in treatment with us. Let us know if you are interested in this option. What about medication? Research suggests that the most effective treatments for anxiety often involve a combination of therapy with some sort of psychotropic medication, usually an antidepressant. Sometimes a medication can be helpful in reducing some of the most painful anxiety symptoms in order for a patient to better take advantage of therapy. That being said, medication is not typically a рcureс by itself, but can be used in combination with other forms of treatment to manage anxiety. Your psychiatrist or nurse practitioner is the expert on this subject. If you have not had a medication evaluation, you can tell the person who referred you to this group or your group leader that you are interested in exploring this option. Just let us know! Congratulations on finishing the CBT Basic Group for Anxiety! We hope the group was helpful in explaining the basics of CBT and preparing you for the next steps in your treatment. Please let us know if there is anything we can do to help you with these next steps in treatment.   Your understanding of the material in this manual before the next steps of treatment will enhance your response to CBT treatment.
