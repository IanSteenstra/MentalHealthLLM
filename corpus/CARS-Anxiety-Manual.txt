Within each phase, you will find several topics and activities.	 ÊThe topics do	 Ênot have to	 Êbe completed	 Êin	 Êseparate sessions, but they	 Êshould be	 Êcompleted in the	 Êsequence	 Êlisted. Within each topic,	 Êyou will	 Êsee	 Êthe	 Êobjectives	 Êthat you should achieve, the	 Êmaterials	 Êneeded and the	 Êtime frame for	 Êeach activity.	 ÊYou	 Êwill also	 Êsee bold	 Êface type and italicized 	 Êtype.	 ÊThe	 Êbold	 Êface	 Êtype indicates what you (the 	 Êcounselor)	 Êshould say	 Êto the students.	 ÊThe italicized	 Êtype offers you	 Êadditional information	 Êand	 Êideas	 Êthat you	 Êcan	 Êuse if you	 Êchoose. All other type is general information. The first	 Êphase involves students learning about	 Êanxiety	 Êand how it can be	 Êmanaged (Knowledge	 ÊAcquisition).	 ÊThe second phase involves 	 Êteaching 	 Êthe students	 Êspecific	 Êskills	 Êfor coping	 Êwith their anxiety (Skills	 ÊAcquisition) and the	 Êthird phase involves helping students apply these skills in their	 Êdaily	 Êlives (Skills	 ÊApplication).	 ÊThe first	 Êtwo phases may	 Êbe provided to students in a	 Êgroup or individual	 Êmeetings.	 ÊTheexposure	 Êactivities	 Êinthe	 Êthird phase	 Êrequire brief individual	 Êsessions 	 Ê(15 to 	 Ê30 	 Êminutes)withindividual students	 Êorstudentdyads.	 ÊMore details about each phase are provided below. Phase	 Ê1 During the first phase, students learn about	 Êthe nature of	 Êanxiety; understand	 Êthe connection between	 Êthoughts, feelings, and	 Êbehaviors and	 Êdevelop	 Êavocabulary foreach;learn 	 Êtorate 	 Êthe 	 Êintensity 	 Êof	 Êtheir	 Êanxiety, and create	 Êa	 Êhierarchy of their fears. After students	 Êhave	 Êdemonstrated	 Êthe above	 Êknowledge and have	 Êcreated a	 Êfear hierarchy, they move to Phase 2. Phase	 Ê2 During the second	 Êphase, students learn	 Êseveral skills to	 Êhelp	 Êthem better manage anxiety. The skill set includes 	 Êrelaxation 	 Êtechniques; identifying 	 Êand	 Êmodifying negative self-..talk; and self-..evaluation and reward. Skill development will occur through	 Êdiscussion, modeling	 Êof skills	 Êby	 Êthe	 Êgroup leader,	 Êand through role plays. After students have demonstrated	 Êeach of these skills	 Êin mildly	 Êanxiety-..provoking situations (e.g., role	 Êplays	 Êor	 Êreal	 Êsituations),	 Êthey move to Phase	 Ê3. Phase	 Ê3 During the third	 Êphase, students will apply and	 Êpractice	 Êthe	 Ênewly	 Êlearned skills	 Êduring exposures to the anxiety-..provoking situations that	 Êare listed on their	 Êfear	 Êhierarchy.	 ÊThe practice of new skills takes place through	 Êrole plays and	 Êin 	 Êvivo (real	 Êlife)	 Êexposure	 Êtasks	 Êand continues	 Êuntil the	 Êstudent can (a) apply the	 Êskills	 Êin highly anxiety-..provoking situations,	 Ê(b)	 Êhas reduced 	 Êavoidance 	 Êof	 Êsuch 	 Êsituations,	 Êand(c) hasimproved	 Êfunctioningin	 Êpreviously-..impaired 	 Êdomains.	 ÊHomework It is 	 Êcommon 	 Êfor	 ÊCBT groups	 Êlike	 Êthis	 Êone	 Êto have	 Êhomework	 Êfor students. These	 Êhomework assignments frequently include asking students to	 Êcomplete worksheets	 Êin between sessions	 Êwhen confronted with anxiety-..provoking situations. We recommend that you do not give such	 Êhandwritten	 Êassignments	 Êin 	 Êthese 	 Êschool-..based	 Êgroups.	 ÊThe information on these sheets can be very	 Êconfidential and quite	 Êembarrassing	 Êfor a student	 Êif	 Êdiscovered by	 Êa peer.	 ÊIn addition, many students	 Êare	 Êfairly careless	 Êwith their belongings	 Êand	 Êthis increases 	 Êthe 	 Êrisk	 Êof	 Êa	 Êbreach 	 Êof	 Êconfidentiality.	 ÊAlthough 	 Êwe 	 Êrealize 	 Êthat	 Êhomework completion	 Êcan	 Êincrease the effectiveness of this intervention, we believe that in	 Êa school setting the risks outweigh	 Êthe benefits. Despite this recommendation, 	 Êwe also give	 Êschool mental health professional the	 Êflexibility to make exceptions to this rule on a case-..by-..case	 Êbasis.	 ÊFor example, in some	 Êcases, the student	 Êis agreeable, the risks have been discussed with the student, and a plan	 Êto	 Êminimize those risks has	 Êbeen developed. Nonetheless, having students think	 Êabout	 Êand implement	 Êtherapeutic	 Êconcepts in between	 Êmeetingswith	 Êyou is 	 Êimportant	 Êand 	 Êcan 	 Êfacilitate 	 Êtreatment	 Êsuccess. Thus, instead	 Êof having students	 Êcomplete worksheets	 Êindependently,	 Êyou	 Êare encouraged	 Êto	 Êconduct brief Òcheck-..insÓ 	 Êwith 	 Êeach 	 Êstudent 	 Êonce 	 Êbetween 	 Êeach session. This can	 Êoccur flexibly, for example, when	 Êthe student arrives in	 Êthe morning before the first class, in between classes, during a study hall, during a lunch 	 Êperiod, 	 Êor	 Ê15 	 Êminutesbeforethe student leavesschool. During thesebrief Òcheck-..insÓ, 	 Êcounselors 	 Êshould 	 Êengage 	 Êin a process, called	 ÊReCCaP (which stands	 Êfor	 ÊReview, Complete the Log, Connect to	 ÊTreatment, and Plan).	 ÊThe 	 ÊReCCaP activities	 Êare	 Êdescribed in more	 Êdetail below. If 	 Êyou 	 Êare 	 Êunable 	 Êto 	 Êcomplete a ReCCaP Log with	 Êstudents between	 Êsessions, start each	 Êsession	 Êby having	 Êstudents	 Êcomplete	 Êa	 ÊReCCaP Log. These	 Êlogs	 Êwill be	 Êreviewed by the	 ÊCARS	 ÊSMC during your weekly consultation and data review	 Êsessions. Student Folders Because students will be completing worksheets during sessions and	 Êbetween	 Êsessions	 Ê(i.e., with you, during	 ÊReCCaPPs), each student should have	 Êa	 Êfolder for their	 Êwork.	 ÊORIENTATION SESSION The purpose of the orientation	 Êsession is	 Êto introduce	 Êthe	 Êstudents	 Êto the	 Êformat of the group	 Êand	 Êto each other. The counselor should	 Êuse this session	 Êto	 Êset the tone for	 Êthe group (informal, supportive, interesting, and fun). Time: 15-..30	 Êminutes	 Ê(depending	 Êon the	 Êice	 Êbreaker	 Êactivity	 Êyou choose) Objectives for this Orientation Session ¥ Students will understand	 Êthe goal of the group ¥ Students will be able to describe group rules ¥ Students will understand	 Êwhat confidentiality is and its 	 Êlimits Materials ¥ Optional: Student Folders (to show	 Êwhere confidential work will be kept) ¥ Optional:White board/Chalk Board (for highlighting 	 Êimportant	 Êconcepts) ¥ Materials for Icebreaker Activity (see Appendix page 74) Welcome [Group 	 ÊLeader/Counselor]:	 ÊWelcome to 	 Êthe 	 Êfirst	 Êday 	 Êof 	 Êgroup!	 ÊThe	 Êgoalsofthis group	 Êare(1) tolearn 	 Êhow 	 Êour 	 Êthoughts,	 Êfeelings 	 Êand behaviorswork	 Êtogether, and(2)	 Êto 	 Êlearnhow to	 Êcope with	 Êthingsthatarestressfulin	 Êour	 Êlives.	 ÊWe 	 Êare going	 Êto	 Êtalk	 Êabout these things in	 Êa	 Êcouple of minutes. Before we do	 ÊI want to	 Êgo	 Êover	 Êa	 Êfew things. Review with group members: ¥ Group	 ÊRules: Group	 Êrules should	 Êbe set before the first session. Rules and	 Êrelated 	 Êconsequences 	 Êshould 	 Êbe 	 Êexplained and	 Êmay	 Êbe role-..played. A	 Êsign listing the	 Êrules	 Êmay	 Êbe	 Êposted in the	 Êroom to serve	 Êas	 Êa reminder. ¥ Confidentiality:	 ÊConfidentiality 	 Êshould 	 Êbe 	 Êdefined 	 Êand 	 Êits 	 Êimportance discussed	 Êwith	 Êmembers of the group. The basic expectation	 Êis that students	 Êdo not discuss or mention	 Êanything	 Êthat is shared	 Êin	 Êgroup	 Êoutside of the group	 Êsessions. Students who	 Êbreak this trust may	 Êbe asked	 Êto	 Êleave the group. ¥ Logistics	 Êofgroup	 Êsessions:	 ÊReview 	 Êthe 	 Êstanding 	 Êtime 	 Êand 	 Êlocation 	 Êfor 	 Êthe group	 Êmeetings, how the leader will communicate	 Êchanges	 Êto students, expectations	 Êfor attendance	 Êand informing the	 Êgroup leader of	 Êconflicts. Introductions [Group 	 ÊLeader/Counselor]:	 ÊLetÕs	 Êtake the next couple minutes	 Êto	 Êintroduce ourselves to	 Êeach	 Êother. Please just state your	 Êfirst name and	 Êanything	 Êelse you	 Êwish to say about yourself. I will begin. My name is _________________	 Êand	 Ê_________________.	 ÊContinue with	 Êintroductions. At this point you	 Êmay	 Êwish	 Êto	 Êdo	 Êan	 Êice breaker activity. There are some examples	 Êof these activities	 Êin the	 ÊAppendix for Orientation Session (page 74), but	 Êyou may use one of your own	 Êif you	 Êwish. The activity	 Êshould	 Êbe designed	 Êsimply to get	 Êthe	 Êstudents	 Êtalking, enjoying their interactions	 Êand feeling comfortable. Overview	 Êof CBT Anxiety [Group 	 ÊLeader/Counselor]: As you know, there	 Êare	 Êmany types of feelings	 Êor	 Êemotions.	 ÊSometimeswefeel theseemotions very	 Êintensely	 Êand	 Êother	 Êtimes we do	 Ênot feel them at all. [With 	 ÊGroup]: Brainstorm types of emotions. [Group 	 ÊLeader/Counselor]: Sometimes	 Êthese emotions help	 Êus do	 Êwonderful things.	 ÊFor 	 Êexample,	 Êif 	 Êyou 	 Êcan 	 Êcare 	 Êabout	 Êanother 	 Êperson 	 Êand 	 Êfeel 	 Êhappy 	 Êor 	 Êsad about their	 Êhappiness	 Êor	 Êsadness, you	 Êare likely	 Êto	 Êtreat them well and	 Êdo	 Ênice things 	 Êfor 	 Êthem.	 ÊOn 	 Êthe 	 Êother 	 Êhand,	 Êsometimes 	 Êpeople 	 Êlose 	 Êcontrol 	 Êofsome of	 Êtheir 	 Êemotions 	 Êand 	 Êdo 	 Êthings 	 Êthat	 Êthey 	 Êregret	 Êor 	 Êget	 Êthem 	 Êinto 	 Êtrouble.	 ÊFor example, if someone	 Êgets very angry about something a teacher says, that person	 Êmay	 Êsay	 Êthings or	 Êdo	 Êthings in	 Êclass that get them into	 Êserious trouble. [With 	 ÊGroup]: First, 	 Êidentify 	 Êsituations in 	 Êwhich a	 Êfeeling 	 Êor	 Êan 	 Êemotion helped	 Êsomeone do	 Êsomething nice or helpful. Then, identify	 Êother situations	 Êin which a	 Êfeeling or	 Êan emotion led to 	 Êinappropriate 	 Êbehavior. Sometimes it is easier for students to identify these	 Êsituations in others rather	 Êthan in themselves.	 ÊThus, you can have	 Êstudent report	 Êsituations 	 Êabout othersthey	 Êhaveobserved	 Ê(e.g.,family	 Êmembers, friends, characters on TV). As participation	 Êincreases, have students try	 Êto report	 Êsituations about	 Êthemselves. [Group 	 ÊLeader/Counselor]:	 ÊAs I	 Êsaid 	 Êbefore,	 Êthe goals of thisgroup	 Êare (1)to learnhow thethoughts,	 Êfeelings 	 Êand 	 Êbehaviorsassociated	 Êwith	 Êstress	 Êand	 Êanxiety,as	 Êwellas	 Êhowthoughts,	 Êfeelings 	 Êand 	 Êbehaviorsareconnected,and	 Ê(2)	 Êto 	 Êlearn how to	 Êcope with	 Êstress	 Êand anxiety	 Êin our lives so that we can achieve our	 ÊIdeal Self Goals [With 	 ÊGroup]: Asneeded,reviewideal	 Êselfgoalsfrom ISG. [Group 	 ÊLeader/Counselor]:	 ÊWeÕre going to complete three phases together. In	 Êthe 	 Êfirst	 Êphaseyoulearn 	 Êall	 Êabout 	 Êanxiety 	 Ê(what 	 Êhappens 	 Êwhen 	 ÊyouÕre 	 Êanxious and	 Êwhy). If	 Êthe 	 Êstudents 	 Êare 	 Êreferring 	 Êto 	 Êanxiety 	 Êwith 	 Êanother	 Êword, 	 Êsuch 	 Êas 	 Êstress, 	 Êpanic, nervousness, it may	 Êbe helpful to	 Êuse that term as well. [Group 	 ÊLeader/Counselor]:	 ÊIn 	 Êthe 	 Êsecond 	 Êphase,	 ÊweÕre 	 Êgoing 	 Êto 	 Êlearn 	 Êskills 	 Êfor managing the uncomfortable thoughts and feelings that go with anxiety. In the third 	 Êphase,	 ÊweÕll 	 Êput	 Êthese 	 Ênew 	 Êskills 	 Êinto 	 Êpractice.	 ÊConvey that throughout this process, you	 Êwill work as	 Êa	 Êteam, within the	 Êgroup and	 Êwith	 Êyou.You	 Êwillofferup	 Êsomenew termsand ideas.	 ÊThey 	 Êshould 	 Êshare 	 Êtheir	 Êreactions to these	 Êideas.	 ÊThey should also practice	 Êthe	 Êskills and then offer	 Êfeedback	 Êabout what works and	 Êwhat doesnÕt work.	 ÊYou will	 Êsupport	 Êthem as they try out	 Êtheir	 Ênew skills and	 Êtweak them to	 Êfit their unique situation. Optional Activity to build engagement	 Êand motivation for change (~30-..45 minutes) Motivational Interviewing Four-..Square 	 ÊDiscussion: As the group leader, divide a large paper or white board into fourths by drawing a	 Êvertical and horizontal line through the middle of the paper. (See 	 Êfigure 	 Êbelow).	 ÊAs you ask the following questions, write the studentÕs responses in the corresponding box and be sure to make the lists of studentsÕ responses	 Êlonger for 	 Êboxes	 Ê2 and 4. For 	 Êbox	 Ê1(upperleft	 Êquadrant),askthestudents ÒWhat	 Êaresomeofthe ÔprosÕ offeeling anxious? Examples include Òit	 Êcould help you study for a	 Êtest,Ó Òit	 Êcould help you move out	 Êof the way of danger,Ó Òa	 Êlittle bit	 Êof anxiety could help you practice more of perform betterÓ For 	 Êbox	 Ê2(upperright	 Êquadrant),askthestudents ÒWhat	 Êaresomeofthe ÔconsÕ ofbeing feeling anxious and avoiding situations?	 ÊExamples include Òtoo much anxiety can make you perform poorlyÓ Òif you avoid situations because of anxiety you will miss out	 Êon fun activitiesÓ Òtoo much anxiety can make you procrastinate/avoid doing any workÓ Òanxiety can make you freeze up in a	 Êsituation and make you look stupidÓ What	 Êare some of the unfortunate consequences? For 	 Êbox	 Ê3(lowerleft	 Êquadrant),askthestudents ÒWhat	 Êisdifficult	 Êabout	 Êchangingthe thoughts, feelings, or behaviors associated with anxiety? What	 Êdo you not	 Êlike about	 Êhaving to change?Ó For box 4, ask the students (lower right	 Êquadrant) ÒWhat	 Êmight	 Êbe 	 Êgood about	 Êchanging the thoughts, feelings, or behaviors associated with anxiety? What	 Êare some benefits of changing?Ó Then engage them in a	 Êdiscussion that	 Êelicits change talk and builds and/or reinforces their motivation for changing. Focus on reflecting the positive possibilities of change. Reflect	 Êthat	 Êthe work may be difficult	 Êbut	 Êthat	 Êthe benefits may outweigh the costs. The therapist	 Êshould ask students what	 Êthey noticed when they went	 Êthrough each list	 Êand compared the list. Point	 Êout	 Êthat	 Êboxes 2 and 4 are longer, and that	 Êa	 Êsmall about	 Êof anxiety can be helpful, but	 Êtoo much anxiety is problematic/gets in the way of good performance. Note: this can be a	 Êlong discussion for students. We have found that	 Êsome sort	 Êof movement	 Êbreak is helpful to break it	 Êup! To	 Êend	 Êthegroup, give 	 Êany 	 Êinstructions 	 Êfor	 Êattending 	 Êthe 	 Ênext	 Êmeeting 	 Êor	 Êproceed to Phase 1	 Êactivities. PHASE 1: KNOWLEDGE ACQUISITION There are four topics in 	 Êthis 	 Êsection ¥ Understanding Anxiety ¥ Understanding the Connection	 Êbetween Thoughts, Feelings, and	 ÊBehaviors ¥ Feeling Intensity Ratings ¥ Creating a Fear Hierarchy The topics do not have to	 Êbe completed	 Êin	 Êseparate sessions,	 Êbut they should be completed in the	 Êsequence	 Êlisted.	 ÊEach	 Êwill likely take 15-..30	 Êminutes,	 Êdepending on	 Êthe activities	 Êyou choose	 Êto complete	 Êfor each topic.	 ÊObjectives of Phase 1: ¥ Students will state	 Êin their own words	 Êhow anxiety can be	 Êhelpful and harmful ¥ Students will identify thoughts, feelings, physiological symptoms, and	 Êbehaviors associated	 Êwith	 Êanxiety ¥ Students will provide examples of how thoughts influence feelings and	 Êbehaviors ¥ Students will rate the intensity of their anxiety across a	 Êvariety of situations	 Ê¥ Student will create a	 Êfear hierarchy of the situations that will be addressed through exposure	 Êtasks To	 Êdetermine if each student is	 Êready	 Êto move	 Êto Phase	 Ê2, Counselors/Group facilitators will	 Êhave students	 Êcomplete	 Êthe	 ÊEnd of Phase	 Ê1	 ÊAssessment (see	 Êpage	 Ê86). Topic 1: Understanding Anxiety Time: 15	 Êminutes	 Êwith no activity; 30	 Êminutes	 Êwith an activity	 Ê(recommended) Outline ¥ Define anxiety ¥ Normalize anxiety and	 Êdiscuss how it helps us ¥ Describe the components of anxiety o Physiological Symptoms o Feelings o Thoughts o Behaviors Materials Needed (See Appendix pages 76-..77 for	 Êhandouts) ¥ White board/chalk board ¥ White paper and colored pens/pencils/markers ¥ Optional: Poster board/butcher paper ¥ Optional: Upside Down U-..Shaped	 ÊCurve of Anxiety Handout (page	 Ê76) ¥ Optional Physiology of Anxiety Handout (page	 Ê77) [Group 	 ÊLeader/Counselor]:	 ÊWelcome back! In 	 Êorder 	 Êto 	 Êbetter 	 Êcope 	 Êwith 	 Êanxiety,	 Êwe need to first understand what it is. How	 Êwould each of you define or describe anxiety? [With 	 ÊGroup]: Let students	 Êoffer ideas. You	 Êcould	 Êwrite the ideas on	 Êa	 Êwhite board	 Êto show that	 Êeach idea is valid and important. You	 Êcould	 Êuse the following	 Êdefinition	 Êto	 Êsummarize their responses. [Group 	 ÊLeader/Counselor]:	 ÊAnxiety has been	 Êdefined as	 Êa	 Êsudden rush of	 Êintense 	 Êfear 	 Êor nervousness often	 Êassociated	 Êwith	 Êfeelings of impending	 Êdoom or	 Ênegative thoughts, and	 Êaccompanied	 Êby	 Êseveral physical symptoms (e.g., muscle tension, sweaty	 Êpalms, rapid heart rate, shortness	 Êof	 Êbreath, chest tightness,). [Group 	 ÊLeader/Counselor]:	 ÊAlthough there 	 Êare 	 Êcommonalities 	 Êin 	 Êthe 	 Êway 	 Êpeople experience	 Êanxiety, anxiety can also look and feel really different for different people. [With 	 ÊGroup]:	 ÊUse their examples to	 Êshow commonalities across students as well as how each student reported unique	 Êthoughts	 Êexperience when anxious. [Group 	 ÊLeader/Counselor]:	 ÊI	 Êwantus to	 Êtalk	 Êaboutthreethings related	 Êto anxiety. First,	 Êanxiety 	 Êand 	 Êstress 	 Êare 	 Êcommon.	 ÊWrite this on the board under #1.	 Ê[Group 	 ÊLeader/Counselor]:	 ÊEveryone experiences	 Êstress	 Êevery	 Êday, and	 Êup	 Êto one in	 Êfour	 Êteenagers has significant difficulty	 Êwith	 Êanxiety, probably	 Êeven	 Êmore so than adults.

When our body needs to prepare to	 Êfight something	 Êor	 Êflee from something	 Ê(e.g., like 	 Êa wooly mammoth in 	 Êcave 	 Êman 	 Êtimes),	 Êall	 Êof 	 Êthe 	 Êsystems in 	 Êour 	 Êbody 	 Êwork 	 Êtogether 	 Êto 	 Êhelp 	 Êus 	 Êtake action	 Êto	 Êsurvive. This	 Êis	 Êcalled	 Êthe fight or	 Êflight system. Think	 Êabout if	 Êyou	 Êwere crossing	 Êthe	 Êstreet, and	 Êall of a	 Êsudden	 Êyou	 Ênoticed	 Êthat a	 Êlarge	 Êtruck	 Êwas coming	 Êyour	 Êway. What would you do? Your anxiety or fear of being run over would motivate you to run to the side of the road (flee). If 	 Êyou 	 ÊdidnÕt 	 Êhave anxiety	 Êabout this	 Êsituation, you	 Êwould	 Êlinger	 Êin	 Êthe road	 Êand	 Êget run	 Êover. If you	 Êhave too	 Êmuch	 Êanxiety, you	 Êmay	 Êpanic	 Êand	 Ênot make a	 Êquick	 Êdecision. Again, refer to	 Êthe Upside Down	 ÊU-..Shaped	 ÊCurve	 Êof Anxiety. [Group 	 ÊLeader/Counselor]:	 ÊSo, anxiety, when	 ÊitÕs	 Êworking	 Êwell, alerts	 Êus	 Êto	 Êdanger	 Êin	 Êthe environment and	 Êhelps us body	 Êprepare to	 Êbring	 Êus to	 Êsafety. WeÕll get back	 Êto	 Êwhat our	 Êbody	 Êis doing in a 	 Êmoment. [Group 	 ÊLeader/Counselor]:	 ÊThird, anxiety	 Êhas	 Êfour main components Write this on the board #3.	 Ê[Group 	 ÊLeader/Counselor]:	 ÊWhenever you are anxious, you have physiological symptoms, feelings/emotions, thoughts, and	 Êbehaviors. Write each on	 Êthe board as part of #3. [Group 	 ÊLeader/Counselor]:	 ÊLetÕs	 Êtalk	 Êabout each	 Êone. Optional activities to help student	 Êunderstand the components of anxiety 1. Lay out	 Êa	 Êlarge piece of butcher paper. Have someone drawn the outline of a	 Êbody. Once the body outline is finished, start	 Êdiscussing the physiological symptoms associated with anxiety and the fight/flight	 Êsystem. Allow students to use different	 Êcolored markers to visually depict	 Êthe location and the experience of the symptoms. Leave a	 Êspace to the side of the body to be able to write down several emotion words associated with anxiety (e.g., nervous, terrified, frightened, afraid). Discuss the thoughts associated with anxiety and allow students to put	 Êthought	 Êbubbles above its head. Leave a	 Êspace to the side of the body to be able to write down several behaviors associated with anxiety (e.g., avoidance, freezing, refusal). Once the diagram is complete, reflect	 Êon how frazzled and stressed the figure looks. This serves to validate the studentÕs feelings of anxiety and panic. You could also discuss how the calming system/parasympathetic system turns off all of these physiological symptoms. Keep this drawing because it	 Êis helpful to refer to it	 Êat	 Êvarious other points in the treatment. For example, with each new coping skill, you can discuss which symptoms, thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that	 Êthe skill addresses. Or you can create another figure later to show the coping thoughts and the improvements that	 Êthe students are making (can lengthen the session by 10-..15 minutes) 2. Give each student	 Êtheir own piece of paper and makers. Have them drawn a	 Êperson or an outline of a	 Êperson. As you discuss each component	 Êof anxiety, have each student	 Êdepict, on the person or on the page, their own experience. At	 Êthe end, have each student	 Êshow their page. This can demonstrate the commonalities of anxiety across students, but	 Êalso that	 Êeach person has their own unique experience of anxiety (can lengthen the session by 5-..10 minutes). [Group 	 ÊLeader/Counselor]:	 ÊPhysiological symptoms are the sensations	 Êyou	 Êget in 	 Êyour 	 Êbody 	 Êwhen 	 Êyou 	 Êare 	 Êanxious. Remember when you were	 Êrunning	 Êaway from the truck in the road? When you get to the side of	 Êthe road, what sensations	 Êare you likely	 Êto feel in your	 Êbody? [With 	 ÊGroup]: Have the students describe what their body feels like after this, or another similar, threatening	 Êevent. They	 Êcan indicate 	 Êthese 	 Êsensations 	 Êon 	 Êthe drawing	 Êdescribed	 Êin	 Êthe activity	 Êbox. Have the students participate in	 Êlabeling	 Êthe symptoms. Alternatively, you	 Êmay	 Êshow students the figure of the Physiology	 Êof Anxiety	 Ê(see	 ÊAppendix page 77). [Group 	 ÊLeader/Counselor]:	 ÊCommon symptoms are ¥ heart pounding ¥ heart racing ¥ dizziness ¥ nausea ¥ smothering sensations ¥ feeling a	 Êlump in the 	 Êthroat ¥ feeling a knot in	 Êyour	 Êstomach ¥ shakiness	 Ê(hands, head, knees) ¥ sweating ¥ blurred	 Êvision ¥ headaches ¥ muscle tension or aches ¥ tightness or	 Êpain	 Êin 	 Êthe 	 Êchest ¥ ringing	 Êin	 Êthe ears ¥ shortness	 Êof	 Êbreath ¥ diarrhea ¥ flushing, blushing ¥ tingling 	 Êin 	 Êthe 	 Êfingers,	 Êtoes,	 Êface ¥ chills Showstudents	 Êthe	 ÊPhysiology	 Êof Anxiety	 ÊHandout (see	 ÊAppendix page 77) if	 Êthat	 Êwould help them better understand these sensations. [Group 	 ÊLeader/Counselor]:	 ÊAll of these	 Êsymptoms occur	 Êbecause your	 Êbody	 Êdetected	 Êa	 Êthreat and	 Êreacted	 Êto	 Êit. This is known	 Êas the fight or	 Êflight response. The	 Êtechnical reason	 Êthat this happens is because	 Êyour Sympathetic	 ÊNervous System turns	 Êon. From here on	 Êout, weÕre going	 Êto	 Êrefer	 Êto	 Êthis	 Êas	 Êthe ACTIVATION	 ÊSYSTEM. [With 	 ÊGroup]: Ask students what they	 Êknow about the fight or flight response. [Group 	 ÊLeader/Counselor]:	 ÊAny time	 Êyour body detects a threat, it activates all the 	 Êsystems 	 Êof 	 Êyour 	 Êbody.	 ÊIn 	 Êmost	 Êsituations,	 Êthis 	 Êis a	 Êgood 	 Êthing.	 ÊWhen 	 ÊyouÕre in 	 Êthe 	 Êroad 	 Êand 	 Êthe 	 Êtruck is 	 Êcoming,	 Êadrenaline surges	 Êthrough your	 Êbody, your	 Êheart beats harder, and	 Êyour	 Êlungs	 Êhelp	 Êyou	 Êbreathe more rapidly to get oxygen and	 Êblood	 Êto	 Êyour	 Êlarge muscles	 Êto	 Êhelp	 Êyou	 Êflee. This	 Êis	 Êwhy	 Êyou	 Êexperience pounding	 Êheart and shortness	 Êof	 Êbreath. Because the blood in your	 Êbody	 Êis	 Êgoing	 Êto	 Êyour	 Êlarge muscles (thighs and	 Êupper	 Êarms), there is less blood	 Êin	 Êyour	 Êhead, hands, and	 Êfeet. This is why	 Êyou may experience	 Êtingling sensations or dizziness. So, you	 Êcan	 Êsee, all of	 Êthese symptoms	 Êare there to	 Êprotect you	 Êand	 Êbring	 Êyou	 Êto	 Êsafety. [Group 	 ÊLeader/Counselor]:	 ÊThe	 Êproblem for many of your right now is that your ACTIVATION	 ÊSYSTEMisstarting whenthereis	 Ênota	 Êrealthreat (e.g.,	 Êin	 Êa	 Êsocial	 Êsituation).	 ÊInstead 	 Êyour 	 Êbody 	 Êis 	 Êtelling 	 Êyou 	 Êthat	 Êthere is a	 Êthreat when	 Êthere really	 ÊisnÕt a	 Êthreat, at least not like 	 Êgetting 	 Êrun 	 Êover 	 Êby a 	 Êtruck. [With 	 ÊGroup]: Ask students what they	 Êthink about this idea. [Group 	 ÊLeader/Counselor]:	 ÊItÕs 	 Êimportant 	 Êto 	 Êunderstand	 Êthat your body	 Êalso	 Êhas a	 ÊCALMING SYSTEM (the technical 	 Êterm 	 Êis 	 Êthe parasympathetic	 Ênervous system). Eventually, your	 Êbody	 Êwill say	 ÊÒOkay, weÕre safe now, itÕs	 Êtime to	 Êcalm downÓ	 Êand	 Êthe CALMING SYSTEM takes	 Êover. Because there is	 Êstill a	 Êlot of	 Êadrenaline in your	 Êsystem, this 	 Êprocess 	 Êcan 	 Êtake 	 Ê15-..20	 Êminutes, but the body	 Êwill not let the ACTIVATION	 ÊSYSTEM go on forever. ItÕs important that you understand these	 Êtwo 	 Êsystems,	 Êbecause 	 Êthe 	 Êskills 	 ÊweÕre 	 Êgoing to	 Êlearn 	 Êare 	 Êgoing to 	 Êhelp 	 Êyoumake sure that your	 ÊACTIVATION	 ÊSYSTSEM only turns on when there	 Êis a real threat for	 Êsafety, and that you can activate your	 ÊCALMING SYSTEM when you need to cope.	 Ê[With 	 ÊGroup]: Ask students repeat what they	 Êhave learned	 Êabout both	 Êsystems. [Group 	 ÊLeader/Counselor]:	 ÊNow,weÕre going move on and talk 	 Êabout	 Êthe feelings	 Êor	 Êemotions	 Êassociate with these physical symptoms. ¥ The	 Êfeelings or emotions associated	 Êwith	 Êanxiety	 Êare typically	 Êstated	 Êwith one word.

Avoidance	 Êinvolves either not doing something that frightens	 Êyou or	 Êdoing it in a	 Êway	 Êthat you stay	 Êaway	 Êfrom the most frightening aspects of the anxiety-..provoking	 Êsituation. There	 Êare	 Êseveral reasons	 Êthat avoidance is	 Êimportant to	 Êunderstand. First,	 Êif	 Êyou 	 Êavoid 	 Êthe 	 Êanxiety-..providing	 Êsituation	 Êyou	 Ênever	 Êgetto	 Êtest	 Êout	 Êif 	 Êyour 	 Êthought	 Ê(ÒI 	 Êknow 	 ÊIÕll 	 Êmess 	 ÊupÓ)	 Êis 	 Êaccurate 	 Êor actually	 Êgoing	 Êto	 Êhappen. You	 Ênever	 Êget to	 Êtry	 Êit and	 Êsee what actually	 Êhappens. Thus, you	 Êcontinue to	 Êbelieve it and	 Êyour	 Êbody continues to	 Êperceive	 Êthese	 Êsituations as a	 Êthreat, which	 Êmeans it continues to	 Êtrigger	 Êyour	 ÊACTIVATION SYSTEM. Second, avoiding	 Êthe stressful situation	 Êis	 Êvery	 Êrewarding	 Êbecause you	 ÊcanÕt mess	 Êup	 Êif	 Êyou	 Ênever	 Êtry. So, in 	 Êthe 	 Êshort 	 Êrun 	 Êthis 	 Êreally seems	 Êlikea	 Êgoodstrategy.	 ÊBut	 Êa	 Êfunny 	 Êthing 	 Êhappens.	 ÊThe 	 Êmore you	 Êavoid	 Êsomething, the bigger	 Êyour	 Êfear	 Êabout that situation	 Êgets. It 	 Êtends 	 Êto 	 Êbuild 	 Êand 	 Êbuild. Third,	 Êwhen 	 Êyou 	 Êavoid 	 Êsituations,	 Êyou 	 Ênever 	 Êget	 Êto 	 Êpractice 	 Êcoping	 Êskills. Think about your	 Êfavorite sports	 Êstar. He/she did not get to be as good	 Êas they	 Êare at that sport without practice. So	 ÊyouÕll need	 Êto 	 Êpractice 	 Êcoping 	 Êskills to	 Êget	 Êbetter 	 Êat	 Êthem.	 ÊIf	 Êyou 	 Êhave 	 Êtime 	 Êat 	 Êthe 	 Êend 	 Êof 	 Êthe 	 Êsession 	 Êor	 Êyou 	 Êwant 	 Êan 	 Êinteractive	 Êactivityina separate	 Êsession to help students	 Êgain repetition with these	 Êconcepts, select an additional activity from the	 Êbox on the	 Ênext	 Êpage. Activities to help students distinguish thoughts, feelings and behaviors 1. Blow up a	 Êbeach ball that	 Êhas different	 Êcolored panels. With a	 Êpermanent	 Êmarker, write each of the following words on each panel: situation, thoughts, feelings, behavior. Throw ball back and forth (or around the group). Tell the students that	 Êwhatever word their thumb lands on, they have to give an example of that	 Êcomponent. This activity can be particularly good for students who have difficulty sitting still or need some physical activity (10 minute activity). 2. Have students write a	 Êpoem or song that	 Êexpresses their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors in a	 Êgiven situation. When complete, have them and/or the group of students identify which parts represent	 Êthoughts, feelings, and behaviors. This activity can be good for groups that	 Êhave students who are more introverted and have difficulty speaking up (20 minute activity). 3. Have scissors, glue, a	 Êposter board, and several age-..appropriate magazines available. Have students cut	 Êout	 Êpictures or words from magazines and paste them on the poster board to represent	 Êthoughts, feelings and actions (additional drawings, words, or art	 Êcan be added). Discuss it	 Êwith the student	 Êas he/she is making it	 Êor have them share it	 Êwith the group. This	 Êactivity can be particularly good for students who respond less well to didactic lectures. They often speak up more while they are engaged in this activity (20-..30 minute activity).	 Ê4. Play a	 Êgame of charades. Have a	 Êpile of index cards, each of which has a	 Êfeeling word written on	 Êit. Take turns (either student	 Êand counselor, or the group of students), picking a	 Êcard and acting it	 Êout. After each turn, discuss the cues (facial features, body language, actions) that	 Êhelped to communicate each emotion. Discuss which cues are similar across emotions and which are more unique to specific emotions. Play another round. During this round, after each emotion is identified, have each student	 Êcreate a	 Êthought	 Êthat	 Êmight	 Êgo with this emotion. Help the group can identify thoughts that	 Êare helpful and thoughts that	 Êare harmful. This activity can be particularly good for students who have difficulty sitting still or need some physical activity (10-..15 minute activity). [Group 	 ÊLeader/Counselor]:	 ÊSo	 Êhopefully	 Ênow you	 Êcan	 Êstate in	 Êown	 Êwords what anxiety 	 Êis 	 Êand how anxiety	 Êcan	 Êbe helpful and	 Êharmful.

The stem represents the thought	 Êthat	 Êstems from the situation (I	 Êknow they are talking about	 Ême. I	 Êknow IÕm going	 Êto say something stupid). The flower represents the feeling that	 Êis produced by these thoughts (i.e., worried, anxious, nervous) Draw a drooping or frazzled flower.

So one way to gain control of our anxiety is to become better	 Êat knowing	 Êhow much anxiety	 Êwe are feeling. To	 Êdo	 Êthis, we need	 Êlearn	 Êhow to	 Êrate the intensity	 Êof anxiety.

Be sure to	 Êinclude some situations	 Êthat	 Êmake you very anxious as well as others that only	 Êcause moderate to	 Êmild	 Êanxiety. For students having	 Êdifficulty	 Êthinking	 Êof enough	 Êsituations, offer situations	 Êthat make many high	 Êschool students anxious. ¥ speaking in front of the	 Êclass ¥ taking an	 Êexam ¥ asking	 Êsomeone out on	 Êa	 Êdate ¥ going	 Êto	 Êa	 Ênew social event ¥ driving It 	 Êmay 	 Êhelpful	 Êfor some	 Êstudents	 Êto complete	 Êthis	 Êbrainstorming task	 Êby writing down	 Êthese situations on	 Êseparate note cards (see	 Êbox below) so that they	 Êcan move them	 Êaround,	 Êsort them by categories (e.g.,	 Êfears related to social,	 Êschool related, 	 Êor	 Êdriving 	 Êsituations) andadd	 Êothersas they	 Êthinkabout dimensionsand their	 Êratings (steps	 Ê2 Ð 4). Activity using note cards In order to create the fear hierarchy, have the students write down each feared situation on separate note cards and have them make an anxiety rating for each situation. Have the students sort	 Êthe cards according to the type of situation. For example, Mary would have a	 Êstack for test	 Êtaking, a	 Êstack for talking with parents, and a	 Êstack for talking with other students For Mary, the stack with the most	 Êcards would be situations regarding test	 Êtaking. Counselors should choose the situation with the most	 Êcards in its stack. Next, counselors should count	 Êthe number of cards currently in that	 Êstack. If the student	 Êhas less than 6 cards, the counselor should encourage the student	 Êto make more levels for that	 Êsituation. Counselors can do this by using the questions used in Step 3. Optimally, each student	 Êshould have one situation with around 6 to 10 different	 Êlevels of that	 Êsituation. Next, have the student	 Êput	 Êthe cards in order from lowest	 Êto highest	 Êanxiety rating. Next, the student	 Êshould transcribe their cards onto the Final Fear Ladder Worksheet	 Êand make an anxiety rating for each row. [Group 	 ÊLeader/Counselor]:	 ÊStep	 Ê2: Rating the 	 ÊSituations: Great!

LetÕs look at MaryÕs list. We can see that how	 Êbig	 Êthe test is really	 Êaffects how worried	 Êshe gets about it. She is much	 Êmore comfortable	 Êwith	 Êopen	 Êbook	 Êquizzes than	 Êbig	 Êstandardized	 Êtests that can	 Êaffect graduation.

Thus, the group leader/counselor should model each skill, briefly and clearly describing each part of the skill. Then, as	 Êstudents	 Êstart to develop the	 Êskill, they	 Êcan serve	 Êas	 Êmodels	 Êfor	 Êeach other. 2. When group leaders/counselors	 Êare	 Êmodeling	 Êskills	 Êfor students, it is	 Êimportant to model	 Êusing a Òcoping modelÓ rather	 Êthan a Òmastery	 Êmodel.Ó This means	 Êthat counselors	 Êshould model the skill with some	 Êhesitancy	 Êand doubt that the	 Êskills	 Êwill work, as well as some optimism	 Êfor giving the skill a try. In a 	 Êcoping 	 Êmodels, the group leader/counselor should make	 Êthe	 Êskill look	 Êdifficult to apply	 Êrather than easy	 Êto apply. For example 	 Êthe group leader/counselor may think out loud for the students	 ÊÒOh, no; the	 Êteacher	 Êsaid that	 Êour	 Êprojects are	 Êdue	 Êby the	 Êend of	 Êthe	 Êweek.	 ÊThat	 Êtotally spiked my anxiety.	 ÊIÕm probably at	 Êa 50 or	 Ê60.	 ÊI know IÕm 	 Êsupposed 	 Êto 	 Êtry 	 Êdeep 	 Êbreathing, 	 Êbut 	 ÊIÕm 	 Êworried 	 Êthat	 Êothers 	 Êwill	 Êsee 	 Ême do	 Êit and	 Êlaugh.

LetÕs look	 Êat an example of the automatic thoughts that a student reported 	 Êhaving	 Êin 	 Êa	 Êsituation 	 Êthat	 Êmade	 Êhimprettyanxious. Nick	 Êwantedtorunforclass president. Each	 Êcandidate was	 Êrequired	 Êto	 Êgive a	 Êspeech	 Êto	 Êthe entire school	 Êduring an	 Êassembly. Nick	 Êwas terrified of giving the speech in front of the whole school. During the speech, Nick	 Êwas to describe how he would help the student body and why people should vote for him. About a week	 Êbefore he was scheduled to speak, Nick	 Êstarted to get very nervous. Nick	 Êknew that if he was feeling anxious, he must be having some automatic thoughts. He wrote down several things he was thinking when feeling anxious. He thought ÒThey will think	 ÊIÕm a	 Êcomplete 	 ÊidiotÓ	 Ê(mind reading), ÒI 	 ÊshouldnÕt	 Êbe getting	 Êthis nervousÓ (should	 Êstatements),	 ÊÒIÕll 	 Êget	 Êup 	 Êthere	 Êandpass	 Êout	 Ê(fortune telling),	 Êand	 ÊÒI	 ÊdonÕt	 Êhave anything	 Êto	 ÊsayÓ	 Ê(black and white thinking).Ó Write these thoughts (but	 Ênot	 Êthe thinking errors) on the board or provide them	 Êin a handout.

Positive/Higher Rating  Reward  [Group 	 ÊLeader/Counselor]:	 ÊBecause youÕre going	 Êto	 Êstart doing	 Êsome hard	 Êwork to face your anxiety, we need to come up with a list of rewards that you can	 Êgive	 Êto	 Êyourself. Our	 Êtask	 Êtoday (or	 Êin	 Êthe	 Êupcoming	 Êweek) is to	 Êcreate	 Êa	 Êrewards	 Êlist. How would	 Êyou	 Êlike to	 Êreward	 Êyourself	 Êfor	 Êworking	 Êhard? [With 	 ÊGroup]:	 ÊDistribute My Reward List Handouts (see	 Êpage	 Ê99)	 Êand	 Êhelp students	 Êidentify	 Êsmall rewards they	 Êcan	 Êprovide to	 Êthemselves. Some	 Êexamples: earning crazy band bracelets, an hour of	 Êvideo games, an hour on facebook, a	 Êwalk outside. ReCCaP for	 ÊTopic 4:	 ÊMeet with the student before the next session. 1. Review: Have	 Êthe	 Êstudent pick	 Êand review situation in which he/she	 Êused successfully	 Êchallenged his/her automatic	 Êthoughts. 2. Complete the Log: Complete the top	 Êand	 Êbottom rows of boxes this week to reflect	 Êwhat	 Êhappened in the above situation.	 Ê3. Connect to	 ÊTreatment: Have the student discuss his/her self-..evaluation for	 Êtheabovesituation as well	 Êasher	 Êself-..reward.	 ÊIf	 Êthey 	 Êforgot	 Êto	 Êself.reward, create a plan	 Êfor them to	 Êdo	 Êso	 Êin	 Êthe next 24 hours. 4. Plan: 	 ÊHave 	 Êthe 	 Êstudent	 Êdescribe 	 Êhow 	 Êhe/she 	 Êwill	 Êreward 	 Êherself	 Êfor	 Êusing the skill	 Êand how he/she plans to use it	 Êagain in the future? PHASE 3: SKILLS	 ÊPRACTICE After completing Phase 2, the students	 Êshould be	 Êable	 Êto demonstrate	 Êthe	 Êskills	 Êof relaxation, 	 Êidentifying 	 Êand 	 Êmodifying 	 Ênegative 	 Êself-..talk, and self-..evaluation and reward.	 ÊOnce 	 Êstudents 	 Êcan 	 Êdemonstrate 	 Êthese 	 Êskillseitherin group orin ReCCap situations, they	 Êmove to Phase 3. The key to	 ÊPhase	 Ê3 is to facilitate therapeutic	 Êexposure to feared situations. Exposure means facing the situations that make you	 Ênervous. During the third	 Êphase, students will apply and	 Êpractice the newly learned	 Êskills in	 Êincreasingly anxiety-..provoking situations. The practicing of new skills takes place through imagined 	 Êexposures, role 	 Êplays,	 Êand in-..vivo exposure	 Êtasks	 Êand continues	 Êuntil the	 Êstudent can apply	 Êthe	 Êskills	 Êin highly	 Êanxiety-..provoking situations,	 Êhas reduced avoidance	 Êof such situations,	 Êand/or has improved	 Êfunctioning in	 Êpreviously.impaired 	 Êdomains.	 ÊImportant 	 ÊNotes:	 Ê1. Because	 Êexposure	 Êis	 Êso challenging	 Êto students, it is	 Êimportant that they understand	 Êthe rationale for	 Êit	 Êand that	 Êthey	 Êknow that	 Êthe process will	 Ênot	 Êmove at a	 Êpace	 Êthat is	 Êfaster than	 Êthey can	 Êhandle. Although	 Êyou	 Êwill gently push	 Êthem to continually	 Êtake on more challenging situations, they	 Êneed to feel	 Êsafe and know that, ultimately, they	 Êcan control	 Êthe rate of	 Êthe process.	 ÊThis is described	 Êin	 Êthe ORIENTATION TO PHASE 3 below. 2. Although 	 ÊPhase 1 	 Êand 	 ÊPhase 	 Ê2 provide a necessary and	 Êcritical foundation	 Êto	 Êsuccess	 Êwith CBT treatment for anxiety, they	 Êare	 Ênot sufficient to produce lasting changein 	 Êstudent	 Êbehavior.	 ÊExposureis a	 Ênecessaryelementto	 Êtreatment success. Thus,groupleaders/counselors	 Êmust	 Ênot lose 	 Êinterest	 Êor	 Êallow 	 Êstudents to lose interest	 Êin the process before completing Phase	 Ê3. 3. Most group leaders/counselors	 Êdo too few exposures.	 ÊThe benefits of	 Êexposure (student	 Êsuccess, mastery, and confidence)	 Êare	 Êonly	 Êachieved through repetition. Thus, just when	 Êyou	 Êthink you	 Êhave done enough	 Êexposure tasks, do	 Êone or two	 Êmore to ensure mastery and maintenance of the skills. Objectives: ¥ Students will understand	 Êthe process and	 Êrationale for exposure tasks ¥ Students will demonstrate the processes	 Êof planning for	 Êan exposure	 Êtask and reviewing	 Êthe	 Êtask after completion ¥ Students will successfully complete multiple exposure tasks for each	 Êsituation on their hierarchy Topic 1: Orientation	 Êto	 ÊExposure Tasks ALL	 ÊSTUDENTS	 ÊMUST	 ÊPARTICIPATE	 ÊIN	 ÊTHIS	 ÊORIENTATION	 ÊSESSION	 ÊBEFORE	 ÊENGAGING	 ÊIN	 ÊEXPOSURE	 ÊTASKS. Time: 30	 Êminutes	 Êto allow for enough discussion Outline ¥ Define exposure o Ensure the student that exposure tasks will start with	 Êsituations that are	 Êlower on their fear hierarchy ¥ Describe the rationale and	 Êreason	 Êfor	 Êexposure	 Êo Habituation o Practice of coping skills o Identification 	 Êof 	 Êautomatic 	 Êthoughts o Challenging of automatic thoughts ¥ Describe the process of preparing for and	 Êcompleting an	 Êexposure task ¥ Give to	 Êstudent and opportunity to discuss	 Êtheir concerns	 Êto the	 Êpoint that they	 Êfeel	 Êcomfortable preparing for	 Êthe first	 Êexposure task Materials Needed (see	 ÊAppendix Phase	 Ê3) ¥ White board/chalk board ¥ Understanding Exposure	 ÊHandout(one	 Êfor	 Êeach student;	 Êsee 	 Êpages 102.103) ¥ SampleExposurePreparation	 ÊHandout(oneforeach	 Êstudent;	 Êsee 	 Êpage 104) It is 	 Êrecommended 	 Êthat 	 Êyou give the handout to	 Êthe students	 Êafter you	 Êhave completed the	 Êdiscussion.

Exposure means	 Êfacing the situations	 Êthat make you nervous.	 ÊWrite this on the board. [Group 	 ÊLeader/Counselor]:Afterall, the 	 Êwhole 	 Êpoint	 Êof 	 Êthis 	 Êprocess 	 Êis to 	 Êhelp you do	 Êthe things that you	 Êcurrently	 ÊcanÕt/or	 Êavoid doing because of your	 Êfear	 Êor	 Êanxiety. Now that you have	 Êlearned how to calm yourself down	 Êand	 Êhow to	 Êmodify your negative self-..talk,	 Êyou 	 Êare 	 Êready to	 Êstart	 Êusing	 Êthesetoolstogether	 Êin real life situations. [Group 	 ÊLeader/Counselor]: We will start with the easier situations and	 Êwork	 Êup	 Êto 	 Êthe 	 Êharder 	 Êones.	 ÊWe will likely start with role plays and imagined 	 Êsituations,	 Êand	 Êgradually	 Êmove to	 Êreal life situations. And we	 Êwill move	 Êat a pace	 Êthat you are comfortable with. If	 Êyou	 Êever	 Êthink weÕre moving too fast, just tell me and weÕll slow	 Êdown. The	 Êgoal is to	 Êhelp	 Êyou	 Êfeel and	 Êbe	 Êsuccessful. [Group 	 ÊLeader/Counselor]:It 	 Êusually 	 Êtakes 	 Êseveral	 Êexposures 	 Êto 	 Êthe 	 Êsame situation 	 Êfor 	 Êyour 	 Êanxiety 	 Êto 	 Êdecrease 	 Êdramatically. 	 ÊThus,	 Êwe 	 Êwill	 Êrepeat 	 Êeach exposure	 Êseveral times until your anxiety for that situation has decreased and you	 Êare experiencing	 Êsome success	 Êin	 Êusing	 Êyour	 Êskills	 Êin	 Êthat situation. Rationale for	 ÊExposure [Group	 ÊLeader/Counselor]: Before we get started	 Êwith	 Êthe exposures, itÕs important 	 Êfor 	 Êyou 	 Êto 	 Êunderstand 	 Êwhy 	 Êwe 	 Êare 	 Êgoing 	 Êto 	 Êuse 	 Êthis 	 Êstrategy.	 ÊThere	 Êare four	 Êreasons	 Êwhy	 Êexposure is	 Êhelpful. 1. Habituation: Write this word on the board. [Group Leader/Counselor]: Habituation means that you get used to a situation. If	 Êyou 	 Êstay in a 	 Êsituation 	 Êlong 	 Êenough,	 Êyour 	 Êanxiety 	 Êwill	 Êeventually level off and decrease. Remember the	 Êactivation and calming systems? Your	 Êactivation	 Êsystem can	 Êonly	 Êstay	 Êactivated	 Êfor	 Êso long, before the calming	 Êsystem steps up	 Êand	 Êtakes control to	 Êcalm your	 Êbody	 Êdown. This is the bodyÕs way	 Êof taking	 Êcare of itself. When you stop being as	 Êactivated	 Êin	 Êa	 Êsituation	 Êthat used	 Êto	 Êmake you	 Ênervous, this	 Êis	 Êcalled	 Êhabituation. You	 Êmay	 Ênot have noticed	 Êthis for	 Êtwo	 Êreasons, either	 Ê(1) the situation was	 Êtoo short for	 Êthe calming system to kick it (e.g., raising your	 Êhand	 Êand	 Êspeaking	 Êup	 Êin	 Êclass only	 Êtakes a	 Êfew minutes) or	 Ê(2) your	 Ênegative thoughts keep	 Êfeeding	 Êyour	 Êanxiety	 Êso	 Êyou	 Êkeep	 ÊÒtellingÓ your	 Êactivation	 Êsystem that there is	 Êa	 Êthreat and	 Êto	 Êstay	 Êalert. Exposure tasks	 Êallow you	 Êto	 Êstay	 Êin	 Êthe situation	 Êlong	 Êenough	 Êfor	 Êyou	 Êto	 Êhabituate or	 Êstart the calming process. 2. Practice: Write this word on the board. [Group 	 ÊLeader/Counselor]: Many	 Êtimes	 Êyour	 Êanxiety	 Êleads you to 	 Êavoid 	 Êor leave 	 Êthe 	 Êsituation. 	 ÊThus,	 Êyou 	 Ênever 	 Êget 	 Êany 	 Êbetter 	 Êat 	 Êdemonstrating 	 Êthe behaviors	 Êthatyou	 Êneed	 Êto	 Êbesuccessful(e.g.,	 Êlike 	 Êdeep 	 Êbreathing 	 Êor correcting	 Ênegative	 Êself-..talk).	 ÊWould 	 Êyou 	 Êexpect	 Êyourself to	 Êbe 	 Êable	 Êto drivea	 Êcar	 Êwellin	 Êan	 Êemergency(e.g.,	 Êget	 Êa 	 Êfriend to	 Êthe 	 Êhospital) if youÕve never	 Êdriven	 Êa	 Êcar	 Êbefore? No. So,why	 Êexpectthat	 Êof 	 Êyourself	 Êwith these 	 Êbehaviors? 	 ÊExposures give you	 Êa	 Êchance to	 Êpractice the needed	 Êbehaviors in	 Êa	 Êsafeplacefirst(e.g.,	 Êwith 	 Ême in	 Êrole 	 Êplays)	 Êand in	 Êreal	 Êsituations	 Êwith your	 Ênew coping skills	 Êand support from me and others. 3. Identifying Automatic Thoughts: Write this on the board. [Group 	 ÊLeader/Counselor]:	 ÊThere	 Êare	 Êlikely some	 Êautomatic	 Êthoughts that only	 Êoccur	 Êwhen	 ÊyouÕre right in	 Êthe middle of	 Êan	 Êanxiety-..provoking	 Êsituation to feed your	 Êanxiety	 Êand	 Êprevent the calming	 Êsystem from starting	 Êup. We need	 Êto	 Êidentify	 Êthe automatic	 Êthoughts	 Êthat are so	 Êpowerful in	 Êmaintaining	 Êyour	 Êanxiety	 Êand	 Êgive you	 Êa	 Êtool or	 Êa	 Êweapon to challenge	 Êthem. Exposures will give	 Êyou	 Êa	 Êchance	 Êto	 Êpractice	 Êusing	 Êa	 Êweapon against these	 Êpowerful thoughts	 Êso that you can start to break the cycle	 Êof anxiety. 4. Challenging Automatic Thoughts: Write this on the board. [Group 	 ÊLeader/Counselor]:	 ÊRight now, you are	 Êconvinced that your automatic	 Êthoughts	 Êare accurate (e.g., if	 Êyou	 Êmess	 Êup, other	 Êstudents	 ÊwonÕt hang out with you). And if you are avoiding situations where you might mess up, you have no way to test if this thought is accurate or	 Ênot. Exposures	 Êallow you	 Êto	 Êtry	 Êthe behavior	 Êand	 Êtest the thought. Two	 Êthings	 Êwill likely happen. First, you may learn that more often than not, you actually	 ÊdonÕt mess	 Êup. Second, even	 Êif	 Êyou	 Êdo	 Êmess	 Êup, students will still hang	 Êoutwith 	 Êyou 	 Êbecause 	 Êmost	 Êpeople 	 Êmessup	 Êon	 Êthingsevery	 Ênow and	 Êthen.	 Ê[Group 	 ÊLeader/Counselor]:	 ÊHopefully now you can see	 Êthat exposure	 Êtasks put it all together. They	 Êaddress the physiology/feelings, thoughts, and	 Êbehaviors of anxiety	 Êand	 Êgive you	 Êa	 Êchance to practice and	 Êget good	 Êat using	 Êthe tools/skills in	 Êyour	 Êtool box. The	 ÊProcess for Each	 ÊExposure [Group 	 ÊLeader/Counselor]:	 ÊNow, letÕs talk about the	 Êprocess for each exposure. Because we want the exposures to	 Êgo	 Êwell for	 Êyou, weÕll take some time planning	 Êfor	 Êeach	 Êone. This process seems a	 Êlittle long	 Êfor	 Êthe first one, but it becomes easier	 Êand	 Êquicker	 Êwith	 Êeach	 Êone we do. [With 	 ÊGroup]:	 ÊDescribethefollowingprocess. Consider	 Êwriting 	 Êthe 	 Êsteps 	 Êon 	 Êthe board. After you	 Êhave explained	 Êthe steps, use the Sample Exposure Preparation	 ÊHandout (see page 104)	 Êand the	 Êcase	 Êof	 ÊMark	 Ê(described below)	 Êto demonstrate	 Êthe	 Êprocess to students. Step	 Ê1: Pick	 Êa	 Êsituation. [Group 	 ÊLeader/Counselor]:	 ÊWeÕll	 Êstart	 Êeachexposure	 Êtaskby reviewingyour	 Êfear	 Êladder.	 ÊInitially 	 ÊweÕll 	 Êpick a 	 Êsituation 	 Êthat	 Êhas a	 Êrating 	 Êaround 	 Ê30 	 Êor 	 Ê40.	 ÊWe donÕt want it to	 Êbe too	 Êanxiety	 Êprovoking, but we also	 ÊdonÕt want it to	 Êbe too	 Êeasy or you wonÕt get practice	 Êapplying your skills. As you successfully complete	 Êexposures with lower ratings, weÕll pick	 Êsituations	 Êwith	 Êhigher	 Êratings. Initially, weÕll also pick a situation that is simple and easy to role play and that is most relevant to	 Êyour	 Êdaily	 Êactivities.	 ÊFor 	 Êexample,	 Êyou 	 Êmay 	 Êbe 	 Êafraid 	 Êof 	 Êgiving speeches	 Êin class, but if	 Êyou donÕt have to	 Êdo	 Êthat this semester, we may	 Êpick	 Êa	 Êdifferent situation	 Êthat you	 Êdo	 Êhave to	 Êdeal with	 Ê(e.g., talking	 Êto	 Êstudents during	 Êlunch). Step	 Ê2: Anticipate	 Êyour automatic thoughts and challenges to	 Êthem. [Group 	 ÊLeader/Counselor]:	 ÊOncewepickasituation,I	 Êwill	 Êhave 	 Êyou 	 Êimagine 	 Êthe situation in as	 Êvivid detail as	 Êpossible. Then youÕll write down 3 automatic thoughts 	 Êthat	 Êyou 	 Êare 	 Êlikely to 	 Êhave.	 ÊWeÕll 	 Êidentify 	 Êthe 	 Êthinkingerrors	 Êassociated	 Êwith	 Êthese thoughts. Then, weÕll write	 Êdown	 Êthe	 Êchallenges to	 Êthese	 Êthoughts 	 Êand 	 Êthe 	 Êhelpful/coping responses. WeÕll write these down	 Êso	 Êthat you	 Êcan	 Êuse	 Êthem as a	 Êscript in	 Êthe	 Êsituation. Use the Exposure Preparation	 ÊHandout (see page 105)	 Êto guide	 Êyou through this	 Êprocess. Step	 Ê3: Work	 Êout the	 Êdetails of the	 Êexposure. [Group 	 ÊLeader/Counselor]:	 ÊNext, weÕll plan out the	 Êsituation. If itÕs a role	 Êplay between	 Êyou	 Êand	 Ême, weÕll discuss the setting	 Êand	 Êthe details of what is going	 Êto	 Êhappen. If itÕs an	 Êimaginal exposure, weÕll talk	 Êthrough	 Êthe sights, sounds, smells,	 Êand 	 Êdetails 	 Êof 	 Êthe 	 Êsituation. If 	 ÊitÕs a 	 Êreal	 Êlife 	 Êexposure,	 ÊweÕll	 Êdiscuss 	 Êthe steps	 Êyou will take before, during, and after	 Êthe exposure. Step	 Ê4: Set an	 Êachievable	 Êgoal. [Group 	 ÊLeader/Counselor]: Just	 Êbefore we complete the exposure, we need to set	 Êan 	 ÊÒachievable 	 Êbehavioral 	 ÊgoalÓ 	 Êso 	 Êthat	 Êwe 	 Êknow 	 Êif 	 Êthe 	 Êexposure 	 Êis a	 Êsuccess.	 ÊThis goal should	 Êbe	 Êvery specific	 Ê(rather than	 Êvague), at a level that you	 Êare	 Êlikely 	 Êto 	 Êachieve,	 Êand 	 Êobservable 	 Êto 	 Êothers. 	 ÊExamples 	 Êof 	 Êspecific 	 Êand 	 Ênon-..specific goals are provided 	 Êbelow. Write these goals down on the Exposure Preparation Worksheet. Specific	 ÊGoals  Non-..Specific	 ÊGoals  Make two statements about myself  DonÕt get nervous  Invite 	 Êher	 Êto 	 Êthe 	 Êdance  Make a good impression  Learn	 Êtwo	 Êthings	 Êabout that person  Be friendly  Ask the teacher about the assignment  Communicate effectively  Stay	 Êin	 Êthe	 Êsituation for	 Ê20 minutes  Feel like I did	 Êa	 Êgood	 Êjob  Step	 Ê5: Complete	 Êthe	 Êexposure. [Group 	 ÊLeader/Counselor]: Just	 Êprior to the exposure, you will make a prediction	 Êabout how anxious	 Êyou	 Êwill get during	 Êthe exposure. We will complete	 Êthe	 Êexposure,	 Êand 	 ÊI	 Êwill	 Êask 	 Êyou to	 Êmake 	 Êratings 	 Êof 	 Êanxiety 	 Êthroughout	 Êthe 	 Êexposure.	 ÊDepending on the	 Êduration of	 Êthe	 Êrole	 Êplay, try to get	 Ê3	 Êto 5	 Êratings	 Êbefore	 Êit	 Êends.	 ÊThese ratings provide concrete evidence that anxiety	 Êis decreasing. Thus, this provides a	 Êcue to	 Êyou	 Êhow the student is feeling	 Êand	 Êhow long	 Êthe exposure needs to last.	 ÊYou must	 Êhave	 Êthe	 Êstudent	 Êremain in the	 Êexposure	 Êuntil	 Êit	 Êdecreases at	 Êleast	 Êa little.	 Ê[Group 	 ÊLeader/Counselor]:I	 Êmay 	 Êalso 	 Êprompt 	 Êyou 	 Êto 	 Êuse 	 Êyour coping statements.	 ÊOffer supportive coaching statements during the exposure if the adolescent is unable to	 Êapply	 Êthem on	 Êhis/her own.

Then	 Êwe will discuss how it went. Specifically, we will review your	 Êpredicted	 Êratings, your	 Êactual ratings, how well you	 Êused	 Êyour	 Êskills	 Ê(deep	 Êbreathing	 Êand	 Êthought restructuring), and	 Êwhether	 Êor	 Ênot you	 Êachieved	 Êyour	 Êgoal. Have students complete the final two questions on the Exposure Preparation Worksheet. To	 Êhelp	 Êyou	 Êprepare for the exposure preparation	 Êmeeting, the exposure tasks, and	 Êthe exposure review meetings,	 Êwe have provided a sample	 Êbelow. ******************************************************************* Sample Role Play	 ÊExposure (The 	 ÊCase 	 Êof 	 ÊMark) Situation: Mark is a	 Êfreshman who is very anxious about	 Êspeaking in groups. On his fear hierarchy, raising his hand, waiting to be called on, and providing an answer is listed at	 Êan anxiety rating of 60. He has significant	 Êanticipatory anxiety while waiting for the teacher to call on him, he worries that	 ÊheÕll pass out, not	 Êbe able to answer the question or look stupid. The	 Êgoal 	 Êof	 Êthis	 Êexposure	 Êis	 Êto 	 Êsimulate	 Êa	 Êclassroom	 Ê(using	 Êthe	 Êcounselor	 Êas	 Êthe	 Êteacher,	 Êand three 	 Êother 	 Êstudents	 Êfrom the 	 Êgroup	 Êas	 Êthe 	 Êclass).	 ÊThe counselor and Mark	 Êhave agreed on the following: ¥ The exposure will likely last	 Ê15 to 20	 Êminutes ¥ The counselor will offer several opportunities for Mark to raise his hand and answer questions, but	 ÊMark will not	 Êknow when these will occur ¥ Mark will raise his hand at	 Êleast	 Êtwo or three times to answer a	 Êquestion, but	 Êhe can decide when he will do this ¥ The counselor will be lecturing on a	 Êtopic that	 Êhas previously been covered in MarkÕs science class and that	 ÊMark is familiar with ¥ In order to obtain anxiety ratings from Mark, the counselor will periodically hold up a	 Êcard that	 Êhas a	 Êquestion mark on it. Each time she holds this up, Mark will quickly report	 Êhis anxiety rating. (Mark can write these down, or he can have a	 Êpeer write down his	 Êratings on a	 Êpiece of paper (see 	 ÊExposure Worksheet	 Êon	 Êpage 	 Ê106)	 Êso that	 Êthe counselor and Mark can review all of them at	 Êthe end of the exposure. ¥ The other students will act	 Êas peers in the class, occasionally raising their hands to answer questions. Prior	 Êto 	 Êthe	 Êexposure, Mark	 Êhas identified automatic thoughts that would likely occur ¥ ÒIÕm going to pass outÓ ¥ ÒThe other student	 Êare going to laugh at	 ÊmeÓ ¥ ÒIÕll say something stupidÓ To challenge these automatic thoughts, the counselor and Mark	 Êexamined 	 Êthe	 Êevidence	 Êfor	 Êeach thought, the likelihood of the situation happening, and the outcomes if it did happen. For the first	 Êthought, they discussed that	 Êeven though Mark feels like he is going to pass out, he actually has never passed out	 Êbefore and he has used deep breathing to reduce dizziness before (see the sample dialogue in the box below). For the second thought, they discussed a	 Êtime when other students have gotten the answer wrong (which happens about	 Ê25% of the time) and how often other kids laugh at	 Êthem (about	 Ê10% of the time because the teacher does not	 Êtolerate disrespect). They discussed how often his answer to the teacherÕs question is correct	 Ê(e.g., about	 Ê75%). They discussed that	 Êeven if kids get	 Êlaughed at, itÕs not	 Êthe end of the world (i.e., people donÕt	 Êstop being friends with someone just	 Êbecause they made a	 Êmistake). For the third thought, they made some connections to the discussion about	 Ênot	 Êpassing out	 Êand about	 Êhow often people make mistakes. They also discussed how well Mark knew the class material. Sample 	 ÊScript	 Êfor 	 ÊTesting	 Êthe 	 ÊEvidence Counselor (C): IÕm wondering if youÕve ever passed out	 Êin class before. Mark (M): Well, not	 Êreally passed out, but	 Êvery close. My body totally freaks out. I	 Êget	 Êdizzy and sweaty and the room is swaying. C: So, 	 Êit really feels like youÕre about	 Êto pass out, but	 Êyou have never lost	 Êconsciousness? M: No, I	 Êguess not. C: If you donÕt	 Êpass out, what	 Êhappens? M: Well, I	 Êusually put	 Êmy head down on the table and close my eyes. C: So, that	 Êhelps you not	 Êpass out? M: Yea, I	 Êguess I	 Êlook up and check the room to see if itÕs spinning. When it	 Êstops, I	 Êknow I	 Êcan sit	 Êback up again. C: Well, IÕm glad youÕve found something that	 Êkeeps you from passing out. Have you ever tried to use your deep breathing or muscle relaxation (hand squeezing) during this situation? M: Yea, actually, I	 Êdid remember to use it	 Êonce or twice. ItÕs hard for me to remember to use it	 Êwhen IÕm freaking out. C: Yes, it	 Êcan be hard to remember to use it. But	 Êit	 Êsounds like you did once or twice. ThatÕs a	 Êgreat	 Êstart. Did it	 Êhelp? M: Yea, I	 Êwas surprised but	 Êit	 Êdid. I	 Êjust	 Êstared at	 Êa	 Êspot	 Êon the wall and after several deep breathes, I	 Êwas feeling better. C: Good IÕm glad to hear this. It	 Êsounds like you were in control of getting your body to go from freaking out	 Êto a	 Êcalmer state. M: Yea, sort	 Êof. C: So letÕs get	 Êback to your first	 Êautomatic thought	 Êand review a	 Êbit	 Êof the evidence. The thought	 Êwas ÒIÕm going to pass out.Ó You said youÕve actually never passed out. So 0% of the time youÕve passed out	 Êand 100% of the time youÕve not	 Êpassed out. What	 Êis the likelihood that	 Êyou will pass out	 Êin this situation in the future? M: Well, when you put	 Êit	 Êthat	 Êway, I	 Êhave to say not	 Êvery likely. C: I	 Êwould agree with you. And, even though this situation makes you very uncomfortable, is there some evidence that	 Êyou can get	 Êcontrol over this in the moment? M: A little, I	 Êguess, if I	 Êcan remember to use my deep breathing. C: I	 Êwould agree as well. Would it	 Êbe helpful for you to give yourself a	 Êcue to remember to do it? Some students have put	 Êa	 Êsmall piece of paper in their pocket	 Êor even on their desk. So letÕs see if we can come up with a	 ÊCoping Statement	 Êto challenge this automatic thought	 Êwhen it comes to your mind. ÒIÕm going to pass out.Ó What	 Êcould you say to yourself instead? M: Umm, how about	 ÊÒIt hasnÕt happened before. If you use your breathing, you can calm down.Ó C: ThatÕs great. LetÕs write that	 Êdown. Do	 Êyou also want	 Êto add this statement	 Êto the paper in your pocket? They identified Coping Statements that Mark	 Êcould use for each thought ¥ ÒItÕs not	 Êhappened before.

She displays the Question Mark Card to get	 ÊMarkÕs initial anxiety rating. Mark says 40. The counselor acting as the teacher, welcomes the students to class, introduces the topic, and passes out	 Êa	 Êworksheet	 Ê(she copied this from MarkÕs science teacher). She asks a	 Êquestion of the group Mark raises his hand but	 Êthe teacher calls on	 Êsomeone 	 Êelse. She displays the Question Mark Card to get	 ÊMarkÕs initial anxiety rating. She displays the Question Mark Card to get	 ÊMarkÕs anxiety rating. Mark says 55. The counselor gives the directions for the worksheet	 Êand how the class is going to complete it	 Êtogether. She begins working through the first	 Êproblem as a	 Êsample. She asks a	 Êquestion of the group. Mark raises his hand and the teacher calls on him. He answers successfully. The teacher continues with the problem. She displays the Question Mark Card to get	 ÊMarkÕs anxiety rating. Mark says 50. Mark is starting to do some deep breathing. The teacher finished demonstrating the first	 Êproblem with the group. She tells them to complete the second problem on their own and that	 Êthe group will discuss their answers when complete. She tells the group to work on the problem and turn their paper over	 Êwhen they are done. While the group works, she walks over to Mark. She displays the Question Mark Card to get	 ÊMarkÕs anxiety rating. Mark says 35. After about	 Ê5 minutes, the students all have their pages turned over. The teacher asks for a	 Êfew students to share their answers. Mark does not	 Êraise his hand. The teacher calls on a	 Êpeer who does. She displays the Question Mark Card to get	 ÊMarkÕs anxiety rating. Mark says 45. The peer answers.

Wow, thatÕsÕ great. LetÕs review them. You said that	 Êyou would answer two questions. Did you do that? M: Yes C: 	 ÊYes, 	 Êyou	 Êdid! You said that	 Êyou would use deep breathing. Were you able to do this? M: Yea, after that	 Êfirst	 Êquestion, I	 Ênoticed that	 Êmy anxiety spiked. It	 Êwas higher than I	 Êthought	 Êit	 Êmight	 Êgo. I	 ÊdidnÕt	 Êthink that	 Êthe role play would be close to the real classroom, but	 Êit	 Êwas. So I	 Êstarted to use it	 Êso that	 ÊI	 ÊwouldnÕt	 Êfreak out	 Êlike I	 Êdo in class. C: First, thatÕs great	 Êthat	 Êyou noticed your anxiety levels and remember to use it. And second, it	 Êsounds like your deep breathing worked. M: Yes, I	 Êguess so. C: You mentioned that	 Êyour anxiety spiked higher than you thought. LetÕs see, yes, you predicted that	 Êyour anxiety would get	 Êas high as 50, but	 Êyour rating indicates that	 Êit	 Êgot	 Êup to a	 Ê55. This is actually pretty close. What	 Êdo think about	 Êthis? M: Well, I	 Êguess these role plays can make things seem pretty real. C: Yes, so thatÕs good because if you prove to yourself that	 Êyou can manage your anxiety in these roles plays, then we can have some confidence that	 Êyou can manage your anxiety in the real situations. Also, I	 Êwas thinking that	 Êthis gives us confidence that	 Êyou are a	 Êgood judge of your anxiety. I	 ÊdonÕt	 Êthink weÕll need to adjust	 Êanything on your fear hierarchy do you? M: No probably not. But, man, I	 ÊdonÕt	 Êwant	 Êto do any role plays that	 Êare rated higher than this yet. C: Ok. ThatÕs important	 Êfor us to consider. Maybe we should repeat	 Êthis one a	 Êfew times until you are more comfortable with it	 Êbefore moving up the hierarchy. M: Ok. C: I	 Êalso wanted to ask you about	 Êyour automatic thoughts. Did you have the ones that	 Êyou had expected? Review them	 Êfrom	 Êthe list. M: Well, I	 Êwas a	 Êlittle concerned about	 Êpassing out	 Êwhen my anxiety went	 Êup to the 55, but	 ÊI	 Êguess since we had talked about	 Êhow my body probably wouldnÕt	 Êdo that, it	 ÊdidnÕt	 Êspiral out	 Êof control. C: Okay, so maybe our discussion about	 Êtesting out	 Êthe evidence for that	 Êautomatic thought	 Êwas helpful. LetÕs remember to do that	 Êagain before the next	 Êexposure. What	 Êabout	 Êthe other thoughts? M: Well, because it	 Êwas a	 Êrole play with other students from the group, I	 ÊwasnÕt	 Êas worried about	 Êthem laughing at	 Ême. But	 Êyea, I	 Êguess I	 Êwas still a	 Êlittle worried about	 Êsaying something stupid. C: And did you say anything stupid? M: No, I	 Êguess not. C: So, thinking about	 Êall of this, what	 Êcan you take from this experience? M: Well, I	 Êguess I	 Êmet	 Êmy goal, so thatÕs cool and these things are more real than I	 Êthought	 Êthey would be so, it	 Êseems like I	 Êwill get	 Êto practice some of the skills youÕre teaching us. C: Yes, those are great	 Êlessons. Even though this was hard and your anxiety spiked a	 Êlittle, you DID achieve your goal, so now you have evidence that	 Êyou can do it. It	 Êalso sounds like your deep breathing can help to calm you down. So remember that, and keep using it. Great	 Êjob today. Should we plan to repeat	 Êthis next	 Êweek? M: Ok C: And in the mean time, try to pay attention to your anxiety cues, and when you feel	 Êyour anxiety start	 Êto spike, you can use the rational responses that	 Êyou used today and your deep breathing. Hang in there. YouÕre going great. ******************************************************************* Questions to guide the exposure review (You may ask any subset	 Êof these and in any order) 1.	 ÊYour 	 Êpredicted	 Êanxiety	 Êrating was a X. Your actual ratings were X, Y, and Z. What do you make of this pattern? Often their predicted ratings are higher than their actual ones. If so, discuss how anxiety can lead us to Ôexpecting things to be worse than they actually areÕ. Discuss	 Êhow we should anticipate this and not	 ÊÔtreat	 Êthese types of thought	 Êas accurate.Õ Also, consider whether adjustments need to be made to the ratings on the fear hierarchy. If the prediction was a good match, you could frame this as the student	 Êbeing a good judge of what	 Êto expect. Indicate that	 Êyou shouldnÕt	 Êhave to adjust	 Êthe fear hierarchy if this is the case. 2.	 ÊYour 	 Êfirst	 Êanxiety	 Êrating	 Êwas X 	 Êand the others	 Êwere Y	 Êand	 ÊZ. What can we learn from this pattern.? If the exposure served to help them	 Êhabituate to their anxiety, the ratings should decrease. If so, use this as evidence to support	 Êwhat	 Êthe student	 Êhas learned about	 Êthe activation and calming system. If not, discuss what	 Êyou might	 Êchange about	 Êthe exposure for the next	 Êrepetition (e.g., inducing more anxiety at	 Êthe start, staying in the role play longer, modifying the exposure so that	 Êit	 Êis more real life, identifying more effective rational responses. 3.	 ÊDid	 Êyou	 Êhavetheautomaticthoughts	 Êthat	 Êyou	 Êexpected	 Êto	 Êhave? If so, praise the student	 Êfor identifying the relevant	 Êthoughts and planning to challenge them. If not, normalize that	 Êit	 Êis common for unexpected thoughts to pop up and discuss how to use these in the next	 Êexposure.	 Ê4.	 ÊWhat	 Êadditional	 Êautomatic 	 Êthoughts	 Êemerged? Develop rational responses to these for the next	 Êexposure. 5.	 ÊHow	 Êwell	 Êdid	 Êthe 	 Êrational	 Êresponse 	 Êscript	 Êdo	 Êin	 Êcombating	 Êthe 	 Êautomatic thoughts? Discuss what	 Êto keep using and what	 Êto refine. 6.	 ÊDid	 Êyou	 Êmeet	 Êyour goal? 	 ÊWhy	 Êor 	 ÊWhy	 ÊNot? Make sure that	 Êthe student	 Êlooks at	 Êthe concrete evidence and does not	 Êuse a thinking error to judge themselves too harshly. Offer praise to the student	 Êwho achieves his/her goal and encouragement	 Êand support	 Êfor those who did not	 Êachieve their goal. 7. What can you take from this experience for the future? Common take away messages to focus on are: If I	 Êhang in there, it	 Êgets easier Even though I	 Êwas nervous, I	 Êstill made my goal Even though I	 Êfeel panicky I	 ÊwonÕt	 Êpass out It	 Êwas harder than I	 Êthought, but	 ÊI	 Êmade it	 Êthrough Once I	 Êget	 Êthrough the first	 Êseveral minutes, I	 Êfeel better IÕm	 Êin more control of me than my anxiety is Deep breathing can help calm	 Ême down in the moment Challenging my automatic	 Êthoughts can help me keep my thinking straight Topic	 Ê2:	 ÊIndividual 	 ÊExposure 	 ÊTasks Time: 20-..30	 Êminutes	 Êdepending	 Êon each individual studentÕs	 Êhierarchy Outline ¥ Complete the Exposure Preparation	 ÊWorksheet with	 Êthe student (see	 Êpage	 Ê105) ¥ Completetheexposure,documentingleast	 Ê3 to 5	 Êanxiety	 Êratingson	 Êthe Exposure Worksheet (page 106) ¥ Review the exposure task, using the questions in	 Êthe box on	 Êthe previous page Materials Needed (see	 ÊAppendix Phase	 Ê3) ¥ Exposure Preparation	 ÊWorksheet (see	 Êpage	 Ê105) ¥ Exposure Worksheet (see	 Êpage	 Ê106) Exposure tasks require creativity.	 ÊThere are several common	 Êexposure activities.	 ÊYou may build	 Êoff of the ideas below as you	 Êcreate the exposure tasks for your students. Activities for Exposures Imaginal	 Êexposures (conduct	 Êthis type of exposure in private): In a	 Êconversation, have the student	 Êtell you about	 Êthe situation in detail, including what	 Êthey see, hear, feel, think, taste, and smell in the situation. Once you have these details, guide the student	 Êthrough the situation in their imagination using all the details you just	 Êgathered. Initially, use vivid descriptions to heighten their anxiety. Use a	 Êlot	 Êof anticipatory anxiety statements to build up the situation. Continue to describe the situation so that	 Êthey remain in the imagined situations for a	 Êprolonged time (5 to 10 minutes at	 Êleast) until they habituate. Remember to gather anxiety ratings 3 to 5 times throughout	 Êthe scenario. See the script for an example. Group Role Plays (using several	 Êstudents	 Êfrom the 	 Êgroup) Create a	 Êclassroom environment	 Êwhere a	 Êstudent	 Êhas to raise their hand to be called upon.	 ÊHave the scenario last	 Ê20 minutes and have the student	 Êraise their hand 3 to 4 times, so that	 Êthey habituate to the task. Group Role Plays	 Ê(continued) Create a	 Êtest	 Êenvironment	 Ê(get	 Êcopies of a	 Êpreviously completed test) where a	 Êstudent	 Êhas to complete a	 Êtest. Have the scenario last	 Ê20 minutes, so that	 Êthey habituate to the task. Create an unstructured social situation (e.g., like students entering a	 Êclassroom before the class starts, lunch time, riding the bus), where student	 Êhave to make small talk/interact	 Êinformally Create a	 Êsituation, where one student	 Êinvites another to do activity Create a	 Êsituation, where one student	 Êhas to initiate a	 Êconversation with a	 Êteacher to clarify information about	 Êa	 Êlonger term project Create a	 Êsituation where the student	 Êmakes a	 Êmistake in front	 Êof others (e.g., gives a	 Êwrong answer in a	 Êclass, pays for something but	 Êgives an inaccurate amount	 Êof money, turns two assignments in, but	 Êin the opposite basket).	 ÊHave peers snicker or make a	 Êteasing statement so	 Êthat	 Êthe student	 Êhas to endure some mild discomfort, but	 Êthen have those peers speak to them nicely again and dismiss/forget	 Êthe mistake so that	 Êthe student	 Êlearns that	 Êmistakes do not	 Êresult	 Êin catastrophe. Have the scenario last	 Êlong enough that	 Êthe student	 Êcan use a	 Êcoping model out	 Êloud Create a	 Êscenario where someone walks into a	 Êroom and others are talking quietly. Create a	 Êparty atmosphere where someone has to tell a	 Êjoke Create a	 Êsituation where the student	 Êhas to give a	 Êspeech or read a	 Êpoem in front	 Êof others In-..vivo/	 Êreal	 Êlife exposures Have the student	 Êengage in any of the above as an in-..vivo task.	 ÊDuring the early in-..vivo exposures, it	 Êmay be helpful to inform the teacher or adult	 Êin the situation that	 Êthe student	 Êwill be completing the exposure. Similarly, students may choose to enlist	 Êa	 Êclose friend to help them. One-..A-..Day-..Keeps-..Anxiety-..Away Tasks Help the students develop a	 Êhabit	 Êof doing one small exposure per day Say hello to someone you typically do not	 Êspeak to Give someone a	 Êcompliment Speak up one extra	 Êtime in a	 Êclass or in a	 Êgroup setting Make small talk with someone Write in front	 Êof others Take a	 Êdrink from a	 Êwater fountain in front	 Êof others Make a	 Êmistake on purpose.

The goal of activity is for everyone in the group to find something they can relate to in someone else. By finding something they connect	 Êon, they ÒlinkÓ arms until a	 Êcircle is formed (the last	 Êperson has to find something to relate to with the first	 Êperson to close circle). The first	 Êperson (Group leader) begins by listing things that	 Êdescribe them (activities they enjoy, their family, pets, vacations, etc) until someone in group hears something they have in common with the first	 Êperson and ÒlinksÓ (put	 Êarms together like one is escorting the other). Then, the second person in the chain begins to list	 Êthings that	 Êdescribe them until someone links to them and so on until everyone is linked in a	 Êcircle. APPENDIX Phase	 Ê1 1. Upside Down	 ÊU-..Shaped	 ÊCurve	 Êof Anxiety 2. The Physiology	 Êof Anxiety 3. Phase	 Ê1	 ÊReCCaP	 ÊLog 4. Situations, Thoughts, Feelings, Behavior Table 5. Spiral of Anxiety Handout 6. Anxiety	 ÊRating	 ÊScale 7. What is Your Anxiety Rating Now? 8. Fear Hierarchy	 ÊBrainstorming	 ÊExample 9. Fear Hierarchy	 ÊBrainstorming	 ÊWorksheet 10.Final Fear Hierarchy 11.End	 Êof Phase 1	 ÊAssessment Upside	 ÊDown	 ÊU-..Shaped	 ÊCurve	 Êof Anxiety The figure below shows anxiety or activation on	 Êthe bottom (x-..axis).

This is when you think situations are either one way or the exact	 Êopposite and there is no in between (things are black or white, but	 Ênot	 Êgrey). For example, someone might	 Êthink that	 Êif you make a	 Êmistake, you are stupid, and if you donÕt	 Êmake a	 Êmistakes, you are cool. This is problematic because in real life everyone makes mistakes, and making mistakes does not	 Êautomatically result	 Êin one extreme (being stupid) or another (being cool). 2. Fortune Telling. This is when you predict	 Êor ÒknowÓ that	 Êsomething bad is going to happen. For example, knowing that	 ÊyouÕll look stupid speaking in front	 Êof the class. This is problematic because there is no way to know the future for certain. 3. Worst	 ÊCase 	 ÊScenario. This is when people believe that	 Êthe worst	 Êthing that	 Êcould possibly happen will happen. For example, believing that	 Êif you speak in front	 Êof the class that	 ÊyouÕll throw up and everyone will see it	 Êand laugh at	 Êyou. Like fortune telling, it	 Êis impossible to predict	 Êthe future with 100% accuracy. 4. Relying On Emotions. This occurs when you think something has to be true because you ÒfeelÓ or believe it	 Êso strongly that	 Êit	 Êmust	 Êbe true. This is problematic because this can cause people to disregarding evidence indicating that	 Êthe belief is not	 Êtrue. 5. Mind Reading. This is when you believe you know what	 Êothers are thinking. For example, when giving a	 Êpresentation in front	 Êof the class one might	 Êthink Òthey must	 Êthink IÕm an idiot.Ó We cannot	 Êknow for sure what	 Êpeople are thinking. 6. ÒShouldÓ and ÒMustÓ. As the name implies, these are thoughts that	 Êinclude the words should or must. For example, ÒI	 Êmust	 Êlook stupidÓ, ÒThey should hate meÓ, or ÒI	 Êshould be better.Ó (Modified from Hope et al., 2000 and	 ÊKendall et al., 2002) Date: ________________ School: _______________ Student Initials: ______________ Automatic Thoughts	 Êand	 ÊThinking	 ÊErrors	 ÊHandout Below are several faces.

Exposure means facing the situations that	 Êmake you nervous. Exposures start	 Êwith the easier situations and work up to the harder ones. Exposures can be role plays with the counselor and group, imagined situations, or real life situations. The goal is to help you feel and be successful. If you ever think weÕre moving too fast or feel too anxious in the exposures, tell your counselor. It	 Êusually takes several exposures to the same situation for your anxiety to decrease dramatically. We will repeat	 Êeach exposure several times until your anxiety for that	 Êsituation has decreased and you are experiencing some success in using your skills in that	 Êsituation. Why is	 Êexposure helpful? 1.	 ÊHabituation: If you stay in a	 Êsituation long enough, your anxiety will eventually level off and decrease. Your bodyÕs activation system can only stay activated for so long, before the calming system steps up and takes control to calm your body down. This is the bodyÕs way of taking care of itself. When you stop being as activated in a	 Êsituation that	 Êused to make you nervous, this is called habituation. You may not	 Êhave noticed this for two reasons, either (1) the situation was too short	 Êfor the calming system to kick it	 Ê(e.g., raising your hand and speaking up in class only takes a	 Êfew minutes) or (2) your negative thoughts keep feeding your anxiety so you keep ÒtellingÓ your activation system that	 Êthere is a	 Êthreat	 Êand to stay alert. Exposure tasks allow you to stay in the situation long enough for you to habituate or start	 Êthe calming process. 2.	 ÊPractice: Many times your anxiety leads you to avoid or leave the situation. Thus, you never get	 Êany better at	 Êdemonstrating the behaviors that	 Êyou need to be successful (e.g., like deep breathing or correcting negative self-..talk). Exposures give you a	 Êchance to practice the needed behaviors in a	 Êsafe place first	 Ê(e.g., with me in role plays) and in real situations with your new coping skills and support	 Êfrom me and others. 3. Identification of Automatic Thoughts: There are likely some automatic thoughts that	 Êonly occur when youÕre right	 Êin the middle of an anxiety-..provoking situation to feed your anxiety and prevent	 Êthe calming system from starting up. We need to identify the automatic thoughts that	 Êare so powerful in maintaining your anxiety and give you a	 Êtool or a	 Êweapon to challenge them. Exposures will give you a	 Êchance to practice using a	 Êweapon against	 Êthese powerful thoughts so that	 Êyou can start	 Êto break the cycle of anxiety. 4. Testing of Automatic Thoughts: Right	 Ênow, you are convinced that	 Êyour automatic thoughts are accurate (e.g., if you mess up, other students wonÕt	 Êhang out	 Êwith you). And if you are avoiding situations where you might	 Êmess up, you have no way to test	 Êif this thought	 Êis accurate or not. Exposures allow you to try the behavior and test	 Êthe thought. Two things will likely happen. First, you may learn that	 Êmore often than not, you actually donÕt	 Êmess up. Second, even if you do mess up, students will still hang out	 Êwith you because most	 Êpeople mess up on things every now and then. How will we prepare for each exposure? Step 1: Pick	 Êa situation.	 ÊWeÕll start	 Êby reviewing your fear hierarchy. Initially weÕll pick a	 Êsituation that	 Êhas a	 Êrating around 30 or 40. We donÕt	 Êwant	 Êit	 Êto be too anxiety provoking, but	 Êwe also donÕt	 Êwant	 Êit	 Êto be too easy or you wonÕt	 Êget	 Êpractice applying your skills. Step 	 Ê2: Anticipate your automatic thoughts	 Êand challenge them. Once we pick a	 Êsituation, youÕll imagine the situation in as vivid detail as possible. Then, youÕll write down 3 automatic thoughts that	 Êyou are likely to have. WeÕll identify the thinking traps associated with these thoughts. Then, weÕll write down the challenges to these thoughts and the rational responses. WeÕll write these down so that	 Êyou can use them as a	 Êscript	 Êin the situation. We	 Êwill use Exposure Preparation Worksheet	 Êduring this process. Step 3: Work	 Êout the details	 Êof the exposure.	 ÊNext, weÕll plan out	 Êthe situation. WeÕll discuss the setting and the details of what	 Êis going to happen. Step 	 Ê4:	 ÊSet 	 Êan	 Êachievable	 Êgoal. Just	 Êbefore we complete the exposure, we need to set	 Êan Òachievable behavioral goalÓ so that	 Êwe know if the exposure is a	 Êsuccess. This goal should be very specific (rather than vague), at	 Êa	 Êlevel that	 Êyou are likely to achieve, and observable to others. Examples of specific and non-..specific goals are provided below. Specific Goals Non-..Specific Goals Make two statements about	 Êmyself DonÕt	 Êget	 Ênervous Invite her to the dance Make a	 Êgood impression Step 5: Complete the exposure. We will complete the exposure, and I	 Êwill ask you to make ratings of anxiety throughout	 Êthe exposure. We will remain in the situation as long as it	 Êtakes for your anxiety to drop. Then we will end the exposure and review how it	 Êwent. Step 6: Review the exposure. After the exposure is over, we will discuss how it	 Êwent. Important	 Êpoints: ¥ Act	 Êout the role play or imagined situation as completely as possible ¥ DonÕt	 Êbreak roles or stop the role play until itÕs complete ¥ Do use your script	 Êas a	 Êreminder, as needed ¥ DonÕt	 Êbe disappointed if itÕs difficult	 Êor doesnÕt	 Êgo well. Remember to praise yourself for effort	 Ênot	 Êoutcome. It	 Êtakes repeated exposures to fully break the cycle. ¥ If	 Êyou avoid experiencing anxiety in exposures, it	 Êmay help in the short	 Êrun, but	 Êit	 Êwill maintain you anxiety in the long run. (Modified from Hope et	 Êal., 2000) Sample	 ÊExposure Preparation	 ÊWorksheet Date: Exposure task/situation:___ Raising	 Êhand	 Êto	 Êspeak	 Êin	 Êclass_________ List	 Êat	 Êleast	 Êthree 	 Êautomatic 	 Êthoughts	 Êthat	 Êyou	 Êanticipate 	 Êhaving	 Êduring	 Êthe	 Êexposure: IÕm going	 Êto pass	 Êout The other student are going	 Êto laugh at me IÕll say something	 Êstupid Identify the thinking errors associated with those thoughts: Worst Case Scenario Forecasting Write	 Êdown 	 Êthe	 Êchallenges	 Êto 	 Êthose	 Êautomatic	 Êthoughts:	 ÊDo I know for certain that IÕll say something	 Êstupid or others will laugh at me?
