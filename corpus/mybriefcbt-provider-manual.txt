My Brief CBT Provider Manual 2.2 This page intentionally left blank My Brief CBT LogoThis page intentionally left blank How to Use This Manual This manual is intended to help you successfully implement bCBT by providing an overall structure for the intervention. Content is divided into six sessions, each      focused on a particular set of skills and objectives:  1.Getting Started (Session 1)2.Engaging in Activities to Improve MoodCORE  3.Managing Unhelpful Thoughts4.Using Relaxation Skills to Manage Stress & Tension5.Improving Health and Wellness6.The Final Session•Please initiate treatment with  the “Getting Started” session.•“Engaging in Activities to Improve Mood,” and “Managing Unhelpful Thoughts”are core bCBT components and should be a central focus of treatment if possible.•Most patients will likely not complete each content area. You are encouraged todetermine with your patient which content will be the most beneficial to cover inthe time allotted.•You may spend more than one appointment on a given session.•Portions of this manual are color keyed in order to aid presentation of the material:Refers to Workbook Page Will help ensure that  you and the patient view the same material.Provider Tips Clinical considerations and suggested strategies to overcome barriers during the session. Using the Patient Workbook •Each section of the provider manual:1.Follows the order of the corresponding section in the patient workbook2.Begins with a summary of the objectives to be covered, referred to as the   session “roadmap.”•You are not expected to walk patients through every line on every page of the patient workbook. Instead, please use the patient workbook flexibly as:1.A tool to facilitate discussion with patients.2.A source of examples for how the skills introduced can be used in daily life.3.A  tool for planning and monitoring between-session work.Using the Abbreviated Manual •The abbreviated manual contains only the information necessary for quickreference and organization, including the session roadmap and thumbnails of thepatient workbook pages.•You are encouraged to use the abbreviated provider manual after you are familiarwith delivery of each content area.Additional Resources •You may access electronic versions of the provider manual and patient workbookon the MyBriefCBT website here: (insert link)•For additional information on brief CBT, please see “A Therapist’s Guide to BriefCognitive Behavioral Therapy” (Cully & Teten, 2008).Session 0 Provider Manual This page intentionally left blank Session 0•The goal of Session 0 is to gain a foundational understanding of the Veteran’smost pressing issues and initiate a transition into brief Cognitive BehavioralTherapy (bCBT).•Session 0 is conducted within the framework of the “5-A’s,” a commonassessment structure in VA Primary Care (for more information, see theClinical Resources webpage hosted by the VA VISN 2 Center for IntegratedHealthcare (CIH; https://www.mirecc.va.gov/cih-visn2/clinical_resources.asp ).•In this session, we present an overview for each of the 5 A phases, followed bya step-by-step description of content to be covered. Example providerdialogue is also included to guide this process.•Session 0 was developed to be used within a 20-30 minute brief assessmentfor VA primary care settings. The approximate time for the Assess Phase is10-15 minutes with final 10-15 minutes focused on the other Phases(i.e., Advise, Agree, Assist, and Arrange). 1.AssessSummary: During this phase, after discussing limits of confidentiality, you will conduct a functional assessment (for more information, see the Clinical Resources webpage hosted by the VA VISN 2 CIH ), risk assessment (mandatory), clinical reminders (i.e., mandatory      screenings), a depression-specific assessment using the PHQ-9, and other optional screenings and symptom measurements that may apply to the Veteran’s most pressing concerns / focus of treatment (e.g. anxiety symptoms, PTSD symptoms, functional impairment).  In addition to your clinical and functional assessment, you will want to identify risk factors, problematic (maladaptive coping) and helpful (adaptive coping) behaviors, social supports and/or opportunities for community engagement/behavioral activation, as well as Veteran attitudes and preferences that may inform treatment planning. This information will allow you to begin to formulate a basic conceptualization of the Veteran’s problems, coping styles (successful and unsuccessful) and treatment options. These initial case formulations should pay close attention to the cognitive and behavioral elements that contribute to or mitigate the Veterans presenting symptoms. This information will be important for future treatment       decisions such as brief CBT module use.  Ultimately, information collected during the assess phase should be used to guide clinical      decision-making about whether bCBT for depression is a preferred initial treatment option to address the Veteran’s most pressing concerns.  Content to Be Covered A.Discuss confidentiality (some patient information may trigger a required release of          information –e.g., suicidal or homicidal thoughts, child or elder abuse).B.Conduct a functional assessment per standard clinic procedures, including the following elements:•Assess the Veteran’s most pressing concerns.•Assess depressive symptoms using the PHQ-9.•Conduct a risk assessment.•Administer any additional screeners and/or symptom measurements as determined by you or your clinic that may apply to the Veteran’s most pressing concerns / focus of treatment (e.g. Anxiety, PTSD, Functional / Social).C.Determine if bCBT for Depression may be an appropriate treatment recommendation given the Veteran’s functional assessment and attitudes/treatment preferences•Gain a sense of the Veteran’s needs and motivation to participate in bCBT•Identify potential problems that could be addressed in a 3 to 6-week individualized treatment sessions. Develop an initial, brief synopsis of symptoms that are most               distressing or impairing to the Veteran (e.g., low mood, anxiety, grief, lonely, unemployed, recent discharge from service).2. AdviseSummary: Discuss additional treatment options with the Veteran to ensure the Veteran is able to make a fully informed and committed decision for their depression care.      Additional treatment options may include: other psychotherapy approaches within             pri-mary care, referral for a depression medication evaluation, referral to a general or spe-cialty mental health clinic outside of primary care, and watchful waiting within      primary care.  When discussing brief CBT as an option, the clinician should provide a rationale about why bCBT is well-suited to address the Veteran’s presenting concerns, integrating       information from the functional assessment and the PHQ9. This conversation will       segue into the Agree phase. Providing tailored information about bCBT should help the Veteran make an informed choice about his/her care. This is also a great time to elicit the Veteran’s motivation for treatment and provide an installation of hope. Content to Be Covered A.Calculate total score of the PHQ-9.B.Review PHQ-9 results with Veteran. Follow-up with Veteran regarding any suicidal/homicidal ideation, conduct a risk assessment and safety planning (as needed), and/orprovide elevated care or referrals as needed (discontinue assessment for brief CBT).C.Engage in a collaborative discussion with the Veteran about available treatmentoptions (e.g., bCBT, other psychotherapies, pharmacotherapy, watchful waiting/casemanagement).•Provide a tailored treatment rationale for brief CBT and elicit Veteran’smotivation.D.Briefly introduce bCBT, including how it is structured and it’s concepts in laylanguage, and introduce the four modules that go along with bCBT. Describe how briefCBT is well-suited to address the problems the Veteran reported during the Assessphase. Highlight the following:•This is a skills-based program to help the Veteran improve mood and well-being•Each session lasts approximately 30-45 minutes•The variety of skill modules available allow the Veteran to choose what will workmost effectively for his/her needs•Treatment involves an individualized plan of action and treatment successrequires the Veteran’s active engagement in treatment and between sessionexercise•We generally recommend Veterans engage in 6 sessions, however, the clinician andVeteran will decide together how many sessions are best for him/her•If needed, sessions can be conducted by telephone3.AgreeSummary: During this phase, the goal is for the Veteran and Clinician to agree on the treatment plan. Discussion should also aim at gaining agreement on what the specific intervention targets will be and what treatment will do to address those targets. Content to Be Covered A.Collaboratively, agree to pursue brief CBT. If Veteran is interested in               pharmacother-apy, arrange for Veteran to be evaluated by a prescribing provider.B.Discuss/explore the Veteran’s motivation and/or challenges for treatment.4.AssistSummary: This is the action phase of the appointment; time is spent providing      education and can include identifying/addressing facilitators and barriers to      treatment. Providing the Veteran with the brief CBT patient workbook and introducing core concepts during Session 0 is recommended as a means of engaging the Veteran in treatment and reducing the amount of content that is covered with the Veteran during Session 1.  Content to Be Covered A.Review what the Veteran can expect, and what is expected of the Veteran to              maxi-mally benefit from treatment. Look to identify potential barriers to the Veteran’s participation and plan for how to address those barriers (e.g. option for conducting sessions by telephone). Veteran’s responsibilities/expectations include:•Being an active participant during and outside of treatment sessions.•Keeping scheduled appointments to help maintain momentum (discuss      schedul-ing and/or cancelation procedures).•After learning skills during each session, we will create an action plan for you to put them into practice.•Putting these skills to use in your daily life is key to improving your mood and well-being.B.Introduce and provide a copy of the brief CBT patient workbook to the Veteran.5.ArrangeSummary: This phase includes making plans for follow-up (scheduled appts., referrals, other elements of the treatment plan such as at-home assignments, and why they are important). Additionally, the Clinician should summarize what was covered during Session 0 as it will provide a foundation to build on in Session 1.   Content to Be Covered A.Briefly summarize what was discussed during Session 0 and review plan for theVeteran to receive around 6 sessions of bCBT, meeting once weekly.B.Identify a return to clinic date and time for Session 1.This page intentionally left blank Getting Started Session 1 Provider Manual This page intentionally left blank Session checklist: Session Roadmap and Check-in 1.Provide information about the program—how we intend to help.2.Establish a session roadmap (agenda) with the patient.3.Complete a mood “check-in,” using the PHQ-9.Identifying Areas to Improve mood and well-being 4.Discuss the patient’s goals related to mood and well-being.5.Discuss interaction of thoughts and behaviors in relationship to mood, andprovide rationale for self-management.6.Introduce Dave and how he identified goals to improve his mood andwell-being.7.Introduce goal-setting, using the SMART framework.8.Develop an action plan for next session.9.Briefly introduce skill modules, and select a module for next session. Areasinclude: Engaging in Activities to Improve Mood; Managing UnhelpfulThoughts; Using Relaxation Skills to Manage Stress and Tension; andImproving Health and Wellness.Provider Manual Key:Refers to workbook page Provider Tips 1.Provide information about the program—how we intend to help.A.Discuss confidentiality (some patient information may trigger a required release of information – e.g., suicidal or homicidal thoughts, child or elder abuse).B.Introduce the purpose and rationale for the intervention.·Instill hope.·Empower individuals and learn skills to self-manage.C.Discuss the patient workbook.·Give patient the workbook. Explain purpose and expected use (e.g., resource for between sessions, workbook exercises, telephone sessions).D.Summarize overview highlights (convey to patient in summary fashion):·This is a skills-based program to help you improve your mood and well-being.·The variety of skill modules allows you to choose what will work most                 effectively for your individual needs.·It involves an individualized plan of action.·We recommend completing at least six sessions, but you and I will work together to decide how many sessions will be best for you.·Each session will last approximately 30-45 minutes.·Telephone meetings are an option. You can decide whether you prefer to have any or all remaining sessions by telephone.E.Discuss patient responsibilities/expectations.·Being an active participant during and outside sessions is important.·Keeping your scheduled appointments will help you maintain momentum(discuss scheduling and/or cancelation procedures).·After learning the skills during the session, we will create an action plan for you to put them into practice.·Putting these skills to use in your daily life is key to improving your mood and well-being.2.Establish the roadmap (set the agenda).Refer to workbook, page A3, “What to Expect in this Session.” Review the session roadmap with the patient (in the patient workbook). This is page A3 of the patient workbook. This session roadmap describes what will happen during the session, including setting an agenda, doing a mood check, and reviewing the previous session's assignment. It also discusses getting started with treatment.3.Complete a Mood Check-in (Administer the PHQ-9).Refer to workbook, page A4, “Rate Your Mood.” A.Administer the PHQ-9 and review the responses.•Record the responses in the CPRS note templateB.Provide feedback to the patient about his/herdepression status.•PHQ-9 Scoring:0-4 = minimal depression5-9 = mild depression10-14 = moderate depression15-19 = moderately severe depression20+ = severe depression A copy of the PHQ-9 on page A4 of the patient workbook. It asks the patient to respond to a list of 9 questions about feelings and thoughts and how often they have been bothered by them in the last two weeks.Clinician Tips: Depression Assessment & Patient Feedback 1)Communicate depression results to your patients and encourage them to activelymonitor their depression symptoms. Patient awareness is an important first steptowards change.2)Use thoughtful and effective language for communicating depression symptomfeedback. Patients will benefit from accurate but encouraging feedback usinglanguage they can understand. For example, when communicating PHQ-9 resultsthat fall in the moderately severe or severe range – you may wish to use the termhigh rather than severe.3)Consider discussing treatment progress related to any changes in depression totalscore or specific depression items. Reinforcing positive change is important –change may occur in total score or specific depression symptoms, depending onthe focus in the prior session(s).4)Addressing negative change is often patient-specific. However, it should also beaddressed with   encouragement and continued practice, and by exploringtreatment options both within and beyond bCBT.4.Discuss the patient’s goals related to mood and well-being.Refer to workbook, page A5, “Improving your Well-being.” Identify areas for improvement. •For patients who have difficulty answering these questions, you may have tohelp construct goals through informed questions.•Identify one or two broad goals for the intervention.Page A5 of the patient workbook. This worksheet lists different aspects of life that the provider and patient may be able to target during there work together. The patient is asked to place a check next to items they think will make a difference in their quality of life, including improving self-image and self-esteem, decreasing feelings of depression, increasing involvement with family and friends, and learning healthy habits to improve sleep.Clinician Tips: The Role of others in the intervention 1)Patients may isolate if they think no one understands what they are experiencingor that they should be able to deal with challenges on their own. Social isolationcan present a major barrier to implementing effective goals/action plans that willhelp patients activate behaviorally.2)We recommend clinicians support and encourage goals that a) reduce socialisolation (i.e., make new connections or strengthen existing connections) andb)leverage the support that valued others can provide.  *Note: Avoid setting goalsthat depend on the behavior of other people for success.5.Discuss interaction of thoughts and behaviors in relation to mood, andprovide rationale for self-management.Refer to workbook, page A6, “How Thoughts and Behaviors Relate to Mood.” A.Use the diagram to demonstrate how behaviors (the things we do) and thoughts(the things we tell ourselves) interact and affect emotions (how we feel). The waywe feel in turn affects what we do and how we think.B.Provide examples of how the elements of the triad interact and impact one another(consider examples of both positive and negative cycles).C.Ask patient how they related to those examples and if there are time when theirthoughts/feelings/behaviors interfere with living their life.D.Clarify the toolbox graphic—the skills learned in the intervention can be thought ofas tools to self-manage thoughts and behavior, and thus feelings or mood.How Thoughts and Behaviors Relate to Mood: This diagram shows how behaviors (the things we do) and thoughts (the things we tell ourselves) interact and affect mood (how we feel). And in turn, the way we feel can affect what we do and how we think. You can improve your mood by learning skills to help you think and act in new ways.6.Introduce Dave and how he identified goals to improve his mood/well-being.Refer to workbook, page A7, “Meet Dave.” Use the example of Dave to help explain the emotional, behavioral, and cognitive  elements of his depression.  This picture shows Dave, a 65-year-old Army Veteran who suffered a back injury two years ago and is unable to work. He became distant from his family and believed his life has little meaning or purpose. He feels down, lacks motivation, unproductive, tired all the time, and stressed out about finances. He has stopped talking to friends and family, spends a lot of the day watching TV, and eats junk food to make himself feel better. He thinks he can't do anything anymore, let his family down, his life is a failure, and that no one understands him. Dave realized that his depression was getting in the way of living a life that was meaningful to him. Dave identified the following areas of his life he wants to improve: he wants to become more physically active, reconnect with family, improve his self-esteem and feel more hopeful about the future, and eat better and manage his pain.Clinician Tips: Using the case example of Dave 1)The case example of Dave will be included in each skill module, so this worksheetserves as the introduction to Dave and the initial application of the CBTframework. The “Meet Dave” worksheet  provides a concrete illustration of theconcepts introduced on page A6 — how thoughts and behaviors relate to mood.2)If the patient is already knowledgeable and/or quickly understands theseprinciples, you are encouraged to summarize the example rather than walkingthrough the specifics.3)The bottom section of the “Meet Dave” worksheet includes broad areas of Dave’slife he wants to improve. You can return to this example when introducing theSMART goals framework for goal-setting in section 7 of this module to illustratehow to translate broad goals into actionable SMART goals.7.Introduce goal-setting using SMART framework.Refer to workbook, page A8, “Setting SMART Goals.” A.Explain what SMART goals are and how defining goals in these terms increaseslikelihood of success.B.Use Dave’s example (A7) to illustrate how to turn more broadly defined areas forimprovement into SMART goals.•“Become more physically active”  =  take a 15 minute walk around theneighborhood three times this weekC.Choose one of the patient’s goals to begin working on. Use SMART goal criteria tospecify the goal and to lead into action planning.This picture discusses setting SMART goals. SMART goals are specific, measurable, attainable, relevanat, and time based. A patient using SMART goals should say exactly what they want to do, have a way to figure out whether they achieved their goal, be realistic - don't aim to high or too low, the goal should really matter to them, and they should set a deadline for finishing the goal. It gives an example of a regular goal (exercise more) versus a SMART goal (I will take a 15-minute walk around the neighborhood three mornings a week).8.Develop an action plan for next session.Refer to workbook page A9, “Initial Action Plan.” A.Define the term ‘action plan’ and explain how action plans relate to the patient’sgoals.B.Explain the basics of a successful action plan.•Guide the patient in selecting a simple behavior-specific goal•Help brainstorm possible ideas if the patient seems stuck.•Consider one or two examples of action plans that other bCBT patients haveselected in the past (e.g., a first action plan for the goal of increasing socialinteraction might be to call a particular friend or family member).C.Complete the “Initial Action Plan” worksheet using the patient’s goal. Ensure thegoal follows the SMART guidelines.D.Refer back to the initial action plan  next session to review his/her progress.Use the lower half of the worksheet to facilitate a discussion about factors thatfacilitated or interfered with progress.This is the initial action plan worksheet from page A9 of the patient workbook. It provides the following prompts: The specific goal or activity I plan to work on, timeline for completing the goal, steps to help me accomplish my goal, possible barriers and ways to overcome them, how important is this gooal to you, how likely are you to complete these steps, what progress did you make on your goal this week, what went well, and what challenges came up.9.Introduce skill modules and select module for next session.Refer to workbook, page A10, “Skill Menu.” A.Review the different modules with the patient.B.Select a module for the next session. Negotiate which module to start with, beingsure to take into account the patient’s preferences.C.Instill hope and encourage patient participation.•Ask the patient for feedback on his/her experience during the session and howhe/she perceives the program.•Address any reservations or concerns the patient might have about you or theintervention.This is the skill menu page from the patient workbook. It tells the patient to work with the provider to select two to three skills that best meet their needs from engaging in activities to improve mood, managing unhelpful thoughts, using relaxation skills to manage stress and tension, and improving health and wellness.D.Wrap up and schedule the next sessionEngaging in Activities to Improve Mood Provider Manual This page intentionally left blank Session checklist: Session Roadmap and Check-in 1.Establish a session roadmap (agenda) with the patient2.Complete a mood “check-in” using the PHQ-93.Review the previous session’s assignment and any other ongoing skills beingused by the patientDeveloping New Skills – Engaging in Activities 4.Briefly review the connection between activity and mood.5.Explore how Dave used the Engaging in Activities session to become moreactive.6.Identify how patient’s current activities relate to their mood.7.Help the patient identify the activities they would like to engage in moreregularly.8.Develop an action plan for next session.Provider Manual Key:Refers to workbook page Provider Tips Session Roadmap & Check-in1.Establish the roadmap (set the agenda).Refer to workbook, page B3, “What to Expect in this Session.” Review the session roadmap with the patient (in the patient workbook). This is page B3 of the patient workbook. This session roadmap describes what will happen during the session, including setting an agenda, doing a mood check, and reviewing the previous session's assignment. It also discusses developing new skills and engaging in activities.2.Complete a Mood Check-in (Administer the PHQ-9).Refer to workbook, page B4, “Rate Your Mood.” A.Administer the PHQ-9 and review the responses.•Record the responses in the CPRS note templateB.Provide feedback to the patient about his/herdepression status.•PHQ-9 Scoring:0-4 = minimal depression5-9 = mild depression10-14 = moderate depression15-19 = moderately severe depression20+ = severe depression C.For patients entering their third treatment sessionor later—explore and discuss patient treatmentresponse, where appropriate.•Measurement-based treatment response definition: PHQ-9 Total score below 10 OR50% reduction in symptoms.A copy of the PHQ-9 on page B4 of the patient workbook. It asks the patient to respond to a list of 9 questions about feelings and thoughts and how often they have been bothered by them in the last two weeks.Clinician Tips: Depression Assessment & Patient Feedback 1)Communicate depression results to your patients and encourage them to activelymonitor their depression symptoms. Patient awareness is an important first steptowards change.2)Use thoughtful and effective language for communicating depression symptom feedback.Patients will benefit from accurate but encouraging feedback using language they canunderstand. For example, when communicating PHQ-9 results that fall in the moderatelysevere or severe range – you may wish to use the term high rather than severe.3)Consider discussing treatment progress related to any changes in depression total scoreor specific depression items. Reinforcing positive change is important – change mayoccur in total score or specific depression symptoms, depending on the focus in the priorsession(s).4)Addressing negative change is often patient-specific. However, it should also beaddressed with   encouragement and continued practice, and by exploring treatmentoptions both within and beyond bCBT.3.Review previous session’s home practice goal and action plan.Refer to their prior week’s action plan sheet A.ACTION PLAN—NEXT STEPS•Discuss the prior week’s action plan with the patient. For example – ask aboutprogress towards the goal (exceeded, met, partially met, did not attempt).Explore what went well and any challenges.•Re-evaluate goal moving forward (continue, modify, discontinue)B.ACTION PLAN—OTHER SKILLS•Revisit any other skills (e.g. prior action plans) being used by the patient.Briefly review these skills and how they are being used. Problem-solve whereappropriate and support continued skill use.Prior week’s action plan (front) This is the front of the prior week's action plan worksheet from the patient workbook. It provides the following prompts: The specific goal or activity I plan to work on, timeline for completing the goal, steps to help me accomplish my goal, possible barriers and ways to overcome them, how important is this gooal to you, how likely are you to complete these steps, what progress did you make on your goal this week, what went well, and what challenges came up.Prior week’s action plan (back) This is the back of the prior week's action plan worksheet from the patient workbook. It provides the following prompts: next steps for the plan, and other skills to work on.Clinician Tips: Homework / Action Plan Progress 1)The main reason for reviewing action plan progress is to encourage and help thepatient problem solve to use skills more effectively. Get creative and follow the interestsof the patient in making skills work and modifying skills for future use.2)For patients who are able to easily acquire a specific skill (e.g. accomplish a goal) –consider exploring additional uses or broader applications of the skill. For example,using a relaxation strategy for pain management or sleep – or using a cognitive strategyfor a new area in the patient’s life.3)For patients who are struggling to complete an action plan – consider reviewing theinitial goal and the patient’s interest in the goal. Modifications might involve breaking theaction plan down into more manageable steps or changing to a new skill.Developing New Skills 4.Review the connection between activity and mood.Refer to workbook, page B5, “Behavior and Mood in Depression.” Explain the rationale for becoming more active to improve mood. •Provide psychoeducation on positive and negative cycles of mood andbehavior.•Discuss  how mood can be improved by reincorporating rewarding activitiesthat patient has disengaged from.•Emphasize how taking action, despite feeling sad, tired, or unmotivated canimprove mood and energy levels.This is the behavior and mood in depression page (B5) from the patient workbook. It describes what happens when depression or low mood sets in and how patients can break out of depressive cycles by choosing to engage in activities that are important to them, even when they don't feel like it.5.Explore how Dave used the  session to become more active.Refer to workbook, page B6, “Dave’s Activities.” Use the example of Dave to help explain how increasing activities can improve mood. Clinician Tips: Using the case example of Dave 1)Use the case example to educate the patient on how activities (behaviors)  relate tomood. The clinician is encouraged to summarize the case example rather thanwalking through the specifics if the patient is already knowledgeable and/orquickly understands this connection.2)The case of Dave includes a description of SMART goals. The patient is notexpected to develop SMART goals at this time but rather later in the session. Dave’sSMART goals are provided for example purposes only so the patient can see how totransform desired activities into an action plan.Page B6 from the patient workbook. Dave is an Army Veteran whose low mood got in the way of him doing many activities that are important to him. He feels down, alone, ashamed that he's unproductive, stressed out about finances, and lacks motivation. He spends a lot of the day in bed or watching tv, avoids social activities, and stopped going to church or taking care of things around his house. He wants to reconnect with family and friends, go to church regulary, and get his house in order. His SMART goals are to play with his dog for 10 minutes a day five days a week, shower by 10 am three days this week, do a load of dishes and call his daughter next Thursday, and go to church next Sunday with his neighbor.6.Identify how patient’s current activities relate to their mood.Refer to workbook, page B7, “Record of Daily Activities and Mood.” Assist the patient in completing the worksheet. •Focus on a recent day— identify fluctuations in mood and how these fluctuationsmight be connected with the patient’s behavior.•Pay particular attention to activities that lead to increased positive mood.Page B7 of the patient workbook. It is a record of daily activities and mood. It asks the patient to list what they did today, rate how they felt, and write why they felt that way.7.Identify activities the patient would like to engage in more regularly.Refer to workbook, page B8, “Enjoyable and Meaningful Activities.” A.Distinguish between enjoyable and meaningful activities.•Some patients may want to accomplish something rather than focus on doingsomething pleasant. Be sure to reinforce the patient for choosing somethingpersonally meaningful or pleasant.Page B8 of the patient workbook. It discusses enjoyable and meaning activities that patients may find important. Enjoyable activities are fun, help you feel happier and are more fulfilling. Meaningful activities may not be fun, but once you finish, you feel good about what you just completed. It asks the patient to take action and plan their next steps.Refer to workbook page B9, “Identifying Activities ” B.Discuss the 1) activities the patient would like to do but has not been able to do, and 2) activitieshe/she already does but would like to do more often, within the context of values or goals that areimportant to them.•In the first table, help the patient to identify and write down some  enjoyable or meaningfulactivities he/she currently does.•In the second table, help the patient to identify activities he/she is currently not doing thathe/she would like to do.Page B9 of the patient workbook. It asks the patient to identify enjoyable or meaningful activities that they are currently doing and which ones they want to do that they are not currently doing.Clinician Tips: Identifying Activities 1)If necessary, use the Activity Cheat Sheet page B10 of the workbook to generateideas. Suggest some activities on this list based on what you already know aboutthe patient, and ask the patient which ones look appealing to him/her.2)You may want to ask if there is something that he/she needs to do, has been unableto do, or is avoiding.3)Don’t worry at this point about whether the patient thinks he or she can do theactivity. For  now, just try to create a master list of activities that might provideincreased reinforcement and enjoyment.8.Develop an action plan for next session.Refer to workbook, page B11, “Action Plan” A.Help the patient select one or more activities toengage in to improve their mood.Formulate an realistic action plan  for completingthe activity.•Remind the patient to define their goal interms of SMART guidelines.•Encourage the patient to monitor theirprogress implementing the action plan(see “tracking progress” section at the bottomof the page).This is the action plan worksheet from page B11 of the patient workbook. It provides the following prompts: The specific goal or activity I plan to work on, timeline for completing the goal, steps to help me accomplish my goal, possible barriers and ways to overcome them, how important is this gooal to you, how likely are you to complete these steps, what progress did you make on your goal this week, what went well, and what challenges came up.Refer to workbook, page B13, “Engaging in Activities Tip Sheet” B.Refer to the optional  tip sheet for additionalguidance and encouragement with this skill.•Follow your action plan, not your mood.•Monitor your progress and problem-solvebarriers.•Include others.•Be patient and acknowledge success.Page B13 of the patient workbook. This engaging in activities tip sheet asks patients to follow their action plan, not their moods, monitor their progress and problem-solve barriers, include others, and be patient and acknowledge success.Clinician Tip: Ensuring positive reinforcement for the first action plan. Success with the first action plan will encourage the Veteran to continue engaging in enjoyable and meaningful activities. Work with the Veteran to identify one or two  activities he/she is likely to complete and that are likely to result in an increase in mood. Activities that can be repeated throughout the week are ideal because they  offer more opportunities for positive reinforcement. Clinician Tips: Increasing the likelihood of success 1)Break activities down into smaller steps: Goals may need to be broken down into discrete stepsto make an activity more manageable. •Example:  Veteran sets a goal of planting a small vegetable garden.•Solution: Assist the Veteran by breaking down the overall goal into specific steps, such asselecting which vegetables to grow, planning the garden layout, purchasing plants andother materials, preparing the soil, etc.2)Work around physical limitations: Physical disabilities may limit a Veteran’s ability toparticipate in an activity in the way he/she did in the past. However, there are likelymodifications that can be made to enable the Veteran to engage in the activity. Often functionallimitations can be overcome with a focus on meaning and importance of elements related to aphysical activity.•Example: Veteran previously found pleasure running but is now limited by a physicalcondition.•Potential solutions:•Modify the goal to make it more realistic. Perhaps the Veteran is able to walk shorterdistances or for shorter periods of time or by taking breaks as needed.•The clinician may wish to explore the meaningful associated with running in the past.The Veteran may relate to physical rewards (e.g., felt good to be in shape, endorphins,etc.) but may also have enjoyed the camaraderie of running with others, waking upearly to see the sunrise, or the dedication and training schedule required to runconsistently. If physical limitations do not allow for the physical rewards of running,then the clinician may wish to explore activities associated with the other meaningfulelements (e.g., activating to wake up early and enjoy the sunrise with a cup of coffee,finding a social activity to meet camaraderie needs, or helping the patient to find achallenging activity that requires dedication and planning).3)Maximize the Veteran’s control over activities: It is important to ensure that success of theaction plan is dependent on the Veteran’s actions, not the actions of someone else.•Example: Veteran sets a goal of going to a movie with a friend on Friday but has notalready confirmed that the friend is available that day. Thus the successful completionof this goal is uncertain and largely dependent on the friend.•Potential solutions:•Encourage the Veteran to join an activity that is already scheduled.•Plan for a back-up option should the friend not be able to attend.•Modify the goal so the outcome is within the Veteran’s control.Clinician Tips: When to use the optional mood monitoring worksheets 1)Hourly Monitoring Activity/Mood (page B17).•This detailed worksheet may be useful for Veteranswho have difficulty making the connection betweenmood and activities using the in-session monitoringactivity/mood worksheet.•Some individuals may have difficulty rememberingthe activities they do each day and/or may not beaware of how much time they spend doing thingslike lying in bed, watching TV, or surfing theinternet.•This worksheet may also be useful in identifyingspecific times during they day when the Veteranexperiences low mood. Knowing this informationcan help in developing targeted action plans todisrupt these periods of low mood.2)Daily Monitoring Activity/Mood (page B15).•This worksheet is meant to supplement the“Tracking your progress” section of the Action Planand can help reinforce the connection betweenactivity and mood.•It is best suited to track activities that will berepeated throughout the week (e.g., read for 20minutes every day, take a shower by 10am threedays this week, etc.).Page B17 of the patient workbook.

This session roadmap describes what will happen during the session, including setting an agenda, doing a mood check, and reviewing the previous session's assignment. It also discusses developing new skills and managing unhelpful thoughts.2.Complete a Mood Check-in (Administer the PHQ-9).Refer to workbook, page C4, “Rate Your Mood.” A.Administer the PHQ-9 and review the responses.•Record the responses in the CPRS note templateB.Provide feedback to the patient about his/herdepression status.•PHQ-9 Scoring:0-4 = minimal depression5-9 = mild depression10-14 = moderate depression15-19 = moderately severe depression20+ = severe depression C.For patients entering their third treatment sessionor later—explore and discuss patient treatmentresponse, where appropriate.•Measurement-based treatment response definition: PHQ-9 Total score below 10 OR50% reduction in symptoms.A copy of the PHQ-9 on page C4 of the patient workbook. It asks the patient to respond to a list of 9 questions about feelings and thoughts and how often they have been bothered by them in the last two weeks.Clinician Tips: Depression Assessment & Patient Feedback 1)Communicate depression results to your patients and encourage them to activelymonitor their depression symptoms. Patient awareness is an important first steptowards change.2)Use thoughtful and effective language for communicating depression symptom feedback.Patients will benefit from accurate but encouraging feedback using language they canunderstand. For example, when communicating PHQ-9 results that fall in the moderatelysevere or severe range – you may wish to use the term high rather than severe.3)Consider discussing treatment progress related to any changes in depression total scoreor specific depression items. Reinforcing positive change is important – change mayoccur in total score or specific depression symptoms, depending on the focus in the priorsession(s).4)Addressing negative change is often patient-specific. However, it should also beaddressed with   encouragement and continued practice, and by exploring treatmentoptions both within and beyond bCBT.3.Review previous session’s home practice goal and action plan.Refer to their prior week’s action plan sheet A.ACTION PLAN—NEXT STEPS•Discuss the prior week’s action plan with the patient. For example – ask aboutprogress towards the goal (exceeded, met, partially met, did not attempt).Explore what went well and any challenges.•Re-evaluate goal moving forward (continue, modify, discontinue)B.ACTION PLAN—OTHER SKILLS•Revisit any other skills (e.g. prior action plans) being used by the patient. Brieflyreview these skills and how they are being used. Problem-solve where appropriateand support continued skill use.Prior week’s action plan (front) This is the front of the prior week's action plan worksheet from the patient workbook. It provides the following prompts: The specific goal or activity I plan to work on, timeline for completing the goal, steps to help me accomplish my goal, possible barriers and ways to overcome them, how important is this gooal to you, how likely are you to complete these steps, what progress did you make on your goal this week, what went well, and what challenges came up.Prior week’s action plan (back) This is the back of the prior week's action plan worksheet from the patient workbook. It provides the following prompts: next steps for the plan, and other skills to work on.Clinician Tips: Homework / Action Plan Progress 1)The main reason for reviewing action plan progress is to encourage and help thepatient problem solve to use skills more effectively. Get creative and follow the interestsof the patient in making skills work and modifying skills for future use.2)For patients who are able to easily acquire a specific skill (e.g. accomplish a goal) –consider exploring additional uses or broader applications of the skill. For example,using a relaxation strategy for pain management or sleep – or using a cognitive strategyfor a new area in the patient’s life.3)For patients who are struggling to complete an action plan – consider reviewing theinitial goal and the patient’s interest in the goal. Modifications might involve breaking theaction plan down into more manageable steps or changing to a new skill.Developing New Skills 4.Review the differences between feelings and thoughts.Refer to workbook, page C5, “Feelings vs. Thoughts.” .. Use  the Feelings vs. Thoughts worksheet to examine how thoughts are related to mood or feelings. •Discuss the difference between thoughts and feelings.•These are distinct concepts, but many people use the words thoughts andfeelings interchangeably as a way to indicate what they are experiencing.B.Emphasize that while feelings cannot be changed directly, it is possible to impactfeelings indirectly by challenging negative thought patterns.•The key here is to understand that the way oneinterprets a situation directly relates to moodand overall quality of life. Taking control ofthought patterns can improve how one feels.•Understanding thought patterns can help oneidentify ways of thinking that are and are nothelpful.Page C5 of the patient manual. This page defines feelings versus thoughts. Using the example of Dave, it describes the feelings that he has about a situation in his life and the thoughts that he has because of those feelings.Clinician Tips: Introduction to Managing Unhelpful Thoughts 1)Clinicians should remember that this section of the session is dedicated toestablishing that thoughts and feelings are different – a critical step for futuresections of this work.  This section DOES NOT ask the clinician to help the patientidentify unhelpful thinking – those steps will occur later in the session.2)Feelings are core emotional experiences and are generally not the target ofintervention techniques for CBT. Thoughts ARE challengeable – sometimesthoughts are accurate while other times thoughts can be overly negative, unhelpful,or even emotionally driven (rather than factually driven).5.Distinguish between unhelpful and helpful thinking patterns.Refer to workbook, page C6, “Unhelpful vs. Helpful Thinking.” ..  Review the Unhelpful vs. Helpful Thinking worksheet with the patient. •Explain how reactions to a situation can beunhelpful or helpful and can influencefeelings either negatively or positively.Page C6 of the patient workbook. Unhelpful versus helpful thinking outlines unhelpful thinking patterns versus helpful thinking patterns.Refer to workbook, page C7, “Common Unhelpful Thinking Patterns.” B.Review the Common Unhelpful Thinking Patterns worksheet with the patient, andidentify the three types of negative thoughts that are commonly associated withdepression.•Ask the patient to identify examples ofthese negative thinking patterns in his/herown life.Page C7 of the patient manual. It discusses common unhelpful thinking patterns patients have when depressed about themselves, the future, and the world. It asks the patient if they recognize any of the negative thought patterns in their lives.Clinician Tips: Identifying common types of unhelpful thoughts 1)Your goal in this section is two-fold:a)to help the patient understand how unhelpful thinking patterns connect tosituations and feelings through a series of examples, andb)to explore the concept of adaptive thinking and how changes to thoughtpatterns can translate into improved outcomes (e.g., reduced stress, tension,depression, etc.).Highlight the difference between the objective reality of the situation (e.g., busy day), and the subjective interpretation of the situation (e.g., thoughts like “I’ll never get     everything done”/”this is more than I can handle”). 2)It is important to communicate that the goal of this work is not to create a “sunny”or overly positive way of thinking – rather it is to create a realistic and helpful wayof thinking and to reduce the negative impact of unhelpful thoughts. In reviewingthe example of helpful thinking on page C6, note that the feeling of stress remains,but new, adaptive feelings of confidence and determination emerge.3)Remember that NOT all negative thoughts are unhelpful or maladaptive. A patientfacing a chronic illness may have thoughts like “I do not want to be a burden on myfamily” or “I am likely to die in the next few years.” Neither of these thoughts ismaladaptive without additional evidence. If the thoughts were “I am a burden onmy family” or “I am a failure”– these thoughts hint towards a more distorted oroverly negative interpretation that may in fact be maladaptive thought patterns.4)Beck’s cognitive triad for depression is provided in this section to assist  futurework identifying unhelpful thinking patterns. Identification of unhelpful /maladaptive thoughts can be challenging and often takes multiple sessions toaccomplish. Given the brief nature of this program, the clinician will be challengedto rapidly help the patient identify unhelpful thinking. The Beck model is providedhere to structure and ground the patient’s thinking around possible subject areaswhere unhelpful thoughts may occur. Please avoid using this section in an overly“didactic” or “teaching” style; rather, you are encouraged to introduce theseconcepts in a way that facilitates the identification of unhelpful thought patterns.This may vary from patient to patient, depending on their level of psychologicalinsight.6.Explore how Dave used the session to address unhelpful thought patterns.Refer to workbook, page C8, “Dave’s Thought Worksheet.” Use the example of Dave to help explain how helpful thinking can be used to improve mood.  Page C8 of the patient workbook. This example worksheet for Dave lists his orginal thoughts, like being truly useless, pathetic, and no one care,, feelings, like being depressed, mad, and lethargic, and behaviors, like staying on the couch. He also lists his new and alternative thoughts, like nothing is going to change until I make a change, and new feelings, like determined, hopeful, and motivated.Clinician Tips: Using the case example of Dave 1)Use the Dave example to highlight the connection between what happens and howthe patient reacts in terms of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Of most importanceis to show that although Dave may not have control over his situation (e.g., painand disability), he does have control over his thoughts and behaviors.2)Alternative thoughts can be difficult to generate – it is not expected that the patientdevelop skills in creating more adaptive thoughts at this stage. Rather, the Daveexample is simply showing where Dave “ends ups” with his work. Try to refrainfrom spending too much time on the final column for this example.3)It may be helpful to elicit questions or comments from the patient after you reviewthe Dave example. Checking in with the patient may help you (the clinician) tomore fully understand what the patient understands from this work and what theyexpect to get moving forward.7.Identify unhelpful thoughts that are causing distress for the patient.Refer to workbook, page C9, “Identifying Unhelpful Thoughts.” Review example table (situation/thoughts/feelings/behaviors/alternative thoughts) •Ask patient to complete at least on example ontheir own. Where possible, have the patientcomplete two situations.•The patient should only complete the first fourrows of the table at this time. The focus here issimply on identifying unhelpful thoughts.•Tell the patient to stop at the stop signs, andthat you will return to the bottom two rowslater in the session.Page C9 of the patient workbook. Identifying uphelpful thoughts asks the patient to identify orginal thoughts and their situation, thoughts, feelings, behavior, and list new or alternative thoughts and feelings for the original thoughts.Clinician Tips: Identifying unhelpful thoughts.  1)Identifying unhelpful thinking patterns can be challenging since not all negative thoughtsare maladaptive. Maladaptive thoughts are interpretations of situations or experiencesthat are exaggerated or inaccurate.2)Clinicians may need to revisit this section, given the psychological insight required todistinguish between thoughts / feelings and the complexity of identifying unhelpfulthinking patterns. It may be helpful to explore different situations where the patient isexperiencing difficulties. Linking the thought patterns between disparate situations willgive the clinician a broader perspective on the patient’s unhelpful thinking patterns.Strategies to help patients identify unhelpful thoughts when: •The patient has a hard time verbalizing thoughts: You might try starting with theemotion, and then work back to the thought: “What might have been going through yourmind to make you feel that way?” Or start with the situation, and ask: “What wentthrough your mind right after that happened?”•The patient provides more surface-level, superficial thoughts: Try asking “If that weretrue, what would that mean to you?” “What would be the worst part about that for you?”•The patient phrases automatic thoughts as questions (e.g., “Will I be able to cope?”): Theyare more challengeable if you transform them into the statement underneath (e.g., “Iwon’t be able to cope.”).•The patient gives you part of the automatic thought (e.g., “I thought, ‘oh, no!’”): Ask: “Andthen what might happen?” or “What are you worried might happen?” •You’re not able to identify a challengeable automatic thought right away:  Try askingsome probing questions to understand the meaning of what the patient is saying to you.It’s OK to not know exactly what the challengeable thought is right away.8.Introduce skills to manage unhelpful thoughts: coping statements.Refer to workbook, page C10, “Using Coping Statements to Manage Thoughts.”.. Introduce Coping Self-Statements  (including rationale). •Provide example coping self-statements.Page C10 of the patient workbook. This page defines coping statements and how they can decrease feelings of stress and depression. It lists examples, including "I can do what I need to do," "Even if I make mistakes, it will be okay," and "If I take it one step at a time, I can meet this challenge."Refer to workbook, page C11, “My Coping Statements.” B.Work with the patient to identify coping statementshe/she can use in a variety of stressful situations.•Review tips for using coping statements.Page C11 of the patient workbook asks the patient to identifying coping statements that they can use for stressful situations and offers tips for using coping statements.Clinician Tip: Coping statements Coping statements are introduced here as a quick way to begin to insert helpful       thinking patterns. On the plus side they are easy to develop but on the downside they are often quite general and may not have the potency needed to address more       entrenched unhelpful thinking patterns. For these more difficult patterns, clinicians are encouraged to use the advanced skill in this module. 9.Introduce skills to manage unhelpful thoughts: Evaluating unhelpful thoughtsRefer to workbook, page C15, “Evaluating Unhelpful Thoughts.” A.Introduce the rationale for evaluating unhelpful thoughts. Describe how to examinethe evidence for and against thoughts and how to use this information to identifynew thoughts.Page C15 of the patient manual. Evaluating unhelpful thoughts describes how the patient can evaluate their thoughts by examining the evidence and then identifying alternative thoughts.Refer to workbook, page C16, “Evaluating Dave’s Unhelpful Thoughts.” B.Use the example of Dave to help explain how  examining the evidence for andagainst a thought can provide a more realistic view of a situation and help identifynew, more helpful thoughts.Page C16 from the patient workbook. This page shows how to evaluate unhelpful thoughts by using Dave as an example. It lists his original thoughts after a friend cancels with him at the last minute. His thoughts were his friend must be sick of him and he's a failure. He felt sad, lonely, and worthless. He stayed at home by himself all day watching TV. It provides evidence that does not support the thought, such as his friend needing to care for her sick granddaughter. It challenges those thoughts with new thoughts, including it didn't work out this time to get together, and his new feelings are hopeful and comforted.Refer to workbook, page C17, “Evaluating My Unhelpful Thoughts.” C.Work with the patient to identify 1 or 2unhelpful thoughts, then evaluate theevidence for and against each thought andgenerate a new, more helpful thought.Page C17 of the patient workbook. Evaluating my unhelpful thoughts asks the patient to list orginal thoughts, evidence for and against those thoughts, and new or alternative thoughts and feelings.Clinician Tips: Evaluating unhelpful thoughts 1)Emphasize to the patient that thoughts should be treated as merely thoughts, not facts.Examining the evidence for and against a thought allows the patient to take a step back from athought and evaluate its validity from an objective standpoint. Because depressed patients tendto view situations in an overly negative fashion, evaluating the evidence for a thought will likelyprovide corrective information to suggest a more balanced interpretation.2)Remind the patient that the goal of generating alternative thoughts is not to “turn a negative intoa positive”, but rather to identify a thought that accurately reflects the evidence of the situationand is more helpful in moving the patient toward his/her goals.3)This can be a difficult skill for patients to grasp, so be sure to walk through multiple examplesuntil the patient shows good understanding of the process. Remind the patient that the skill willbecome easier with practice, and that over time the patient will learn to evaluate his/herthoughts more quickly and easily as the process becomes second nature.Strategies to overcome common obstacles in evaluating unhelpful thoughts: •The patient generates a thought that may or may not be true, with no way to know: (e.g., “Iprobably won’t get this job I applied for”). Don’t try to convince the patient that the thought isnecessarily inaccurate (e.g., they will definitely get the job), but that the thought is unhelpfulbecause the outcome is uncertain and buying into the thought could lead to problematic behav-iors (e.g., less confidence and motivation in the job interview).•The patient generates a thought that is actually true: (e.g., “I should not have said that rude thingto my wife when I was angry.”). A true thought is not challengeable. You can often generate achallengeable thought by asking “What does it mean about you that you said that rude thing?”  toelicit the patient’s beliefs that they must be an awful person to have said such a thing (a morechallengeable thought).10.Develop an action plan for next session.Refer to workbook, page C19, “Action Plan.” Help the patient select one or more activities to engage in to improve their mood. Formulate an realistic action plan  for completing the activity. •Remind the patient to define their goal interms of SMART guidelines.•Encourage the patient to monitor theirprogress implementing the action plan(see “tracking progress” section at the bottomof the page).This is the action plan worksheet from page C19 of the patient workbook. It provides the following prompts: The specific goal or activity I plan to work on, timeline for completing the goal, steps to help me accomplish my goal, possible barriers and ways to overcome them, how important is this gooal to you, how likely are you to complete these steps, what progress did you make on your goal this week, what went well, and what challenges came up.Clinician Tips: 1)Ensuring positive reinforcement for the first action plan: Success with the firstaction plan will encourage the Veteran to continue using relaxation skills. Makesure that they initially develop a plan that is focused on practicing these skillsoutside of stressful situations. Later action plans can focus on application after theyhave acquired experience with the techniques.2)Action plans for coping statements: An action plan for this skill may targetunhelpful thinking patterns and substitutes with coping statements for thoseunhelpful thoughts in the patient’s daily life.3)Clinician Tip: Action plans for evaluating unhelpful thoughts: Action plans for thisskill typically involve asking the patient to complete a specific number ofEvaluating My Unhelpful Thoughts worksheets over a specific period of time.This page intentionally left blank Using Relaxation Skills to Manage Stress and Tension Provider Manual This page intentionally left blank Session checklist: Session Roadmap and Check-in 1.Establish a session roadmap (agenda) with the patient.2.Complete a mood “check-in,” using the PHQ-9.3.Review the previous session’s home practice goal and action plan.Developing New Skills – Reducing Stress and Tension 4.Introduce using relaxation and how it applies to the patient.5.Explore how Dave uses relaxation skills to address his needs.6.Review information and skills related to the selected skill and practice theskill in session.7.Develop an action plan for next session.Provider Manual Key: Refers to workbook page Provider Tips Session Roadmap & Check-in1.Establish the roadmap (set the agenda).Refer to workbook, page D3, “What to Expect in this Session.” Review the session roadmap with the patient (in the patient workbook). This is page D3 of the patient workbook.

It asks the patient to respond to a list of 9 questions about feelings and thoughts and how often they have been bothered by them in the last two weeks.Clinician Tips: Depression Assessment & Patient Feedback 1)Communicate depression results to your patients and encourage them to activelymonitor their depression symptoms. Patient awareness is an important first steptowards change.2)Use thoughtful and effective language for communicating depression symptom feedback.Patients will benefit from accurate but encouraging feedback using language they canunderstand. For example, when communicating PHQ-9 results that fall in the moderatelysevere or severe range – you may wish to use the term high rather than severe.3)Consider discussing treatment progress related to any changes in depression total scoreor specific depression items.

For example – ask aboutprogress towards the goal (exceeded, met, partially met, did not attempt).Explore what went well and any challenges.•Re-evaluate goal moving forward (continue, modify, discontinue)B.ACTION PLAN—OTHER SKILLS•Revisit any other skills (e.g. prior action plans) being used by the patient. Brieflyreview these skills and how they are being used. Problem-solve where appropriateand support continued skill use.Prior week’s action plan (front) This is the front of the prior week's action plan worksheet from the patient workbook. It provides the following prompts: The specific goal or activity I plan to work on, timeline for completing the goal, steps to help me accomplish my goal, possible barriers and ways to overcome them, how important is this gooal to you, how likely are you to complete these steps, what progress did you make on your goal this week, what went well, and what challenges came up.Prior week’s action plan (back) This is the back of the prior week's action plan worksheet from the patient workbook. It provides the following prompts: next steps for the plan, and other skills to work on.Clinician Tips: Homework / Action Plan Progress 1)The main reason for reviewing action plan progress is to encourage and help thepatient problem solve to use skills more effectively. Get creative and follow the interestsof the patient in making skills work and modifying skills for future use.2)For patients who are able to easily acquire a specific skill (e.g. accomplish a goal) –consider exploring additional uses or broader applications of the skill. For example,using a relaxation strategy for pain management or sleep – or using a cognitive strategyfor a new area in the patient’s life.3)For patients who are struggling to complete an action plan – consider reviewing theinitial goal and the patient’s interest in the goal. Modifications might involve breaking theaction plan down into more manageable steps or changing to a new skill.Developing New Skills 4.Introduce using relaxation and how it applies to the patient.Refer to workbook, page D5, "Stress & Tension in Your Life.”  A.Use the worksheet to discuss sources of stress in the patient’s life and how stressimpacts their functioning.•You might use an analogy to discuss the impact ofstress, such as the body being like “an engine thatis idling on high” - relaxation skills can be used toslow that engine down.Page D5 of the patient workbook. This worksheet asks the patient to identify sources of stress in their life and how they've been impacted by it. It also asks the patient to check off examples of common sensations of stress and tension in their lives.Refer to workbook, page D6, “Taking Control with Relaxation Skills.” B.Introduce the relaxation skills of  imagery and deep breathing.•Suggest that the signs of stress and tensiondescribed by the patient can be reduced withrelaxation exercises.•Point out that the exercises target physical signsof tension as well as cognitive components, suchas racing thoughts and feelings of fear / anxiety.•Choose one of the two relaxation methods andbriefly describe each method to the patient.Page D6 of the patient workbook. Taking control with relaxation skills gives patients two skills to help them gain control of their stress and tension, deep breathing, and imagery.Clinician Tips: Identifying a Focus of Treatment If you feel it is clinically advantageous, you can recommend starting with imagery OR deep breathing, based on your knowledge of the patient and his/her concerns. It is not mandatory that you cover both techniques—choose what best applies for the patient. 5.Explore how Dave used the relaxation skills to address his needs.Refer to pages D7 & D8, “How Dave Uses Deep Breathing/Imagery.” .. Use the first example (page D7) to demonstrate how Dave applies deep breathing to a stressful situation in his life. •Highlight that Dave was able to calm himself enough to complete a task he wouldhave otherwise avoided.B.Use the second example (page D8) to demonstrate how Dave uses imagery to copewith his back pain.Page D7 of the patient workbook. This page describes how Dave uses deep breathing when he feels worried, has tightness in this stomach, and feels stressed out about finances when at the bank. When he feels like this, he snaps at the bank teller. He uses his deep breathing skills at the bank to stop thinking about his anxious thoughts and feels more in control when he gets to the bank teller.Page D8 of the patient workbook. This page discusses how Dave uses imagery for his chronic pain. He uses this imagery when he feels low, frustrated, or preoccupied with this pain. He avoids physical activity or stays in bed when he is in pain. He thinks he's in too much pain to be productive and like he has no control over his life. His imagery skills helps him relax and distracts from his pain. With regular practice, his overall sense of well-being improves.Clinician Tips: Using the case example of Dave You do not have to review both Dave examples. These are available for you to use if you feel the patient would benefit from concrete examples of how relaxation skills can be applied to cope with  different problems. Turn to the page 7 of this manual for deep breathing. Turn to page 9 of this manual for imagery. 6.(Deep breathing) Use deep breathing to reduce stress and tension.Refer to workbook, page D9, “Using Deep Breathing to Reduce Stress  & Tension.”A.Introduce deep breathing, and review information about the skill.•Discuss how deep breathing works to relievestress and tension.Page D9 of the patient workbook. Using deep breathing to reduce stress and tension describes why and how deep breathing is used.Refer to workbook, page D10, “How to Practice Deep Breathing.” B.Instruct  the patient in how to perform deep breathing.•Prior to practicing in session, have patient attendto how he/she is breathing naturally. Ask thepatient to rate their tension on a 1-10 scale.•Adjust the pace to a rate that is comfortable forthe patient.•Repeat until patient appears to be comfortablewith the technique.•Guide the patient through three to five minutes ofdeep breathing.•After practicing, process the experience with thepatient:•Ask for any general feedback about how this skill seemed to work and tothink of a stressful situation when this skill might be useful.Page D10 of the patient workbook. How to practice deep breathing describes how to breathe more with your stomach and diaphragm rather than your chest. It gives instructions for how to deep breathe and resources for more information.Refer to workbook, pages D10 & D11, “How to Practice Deep Breathing” and “Instructions for Practice .” C.Review instructions for practicing at home.•Stress the importance of mastering the technique before attempting to use it instressful situations.•Refer patient to the optional video demonstration link at the  bottom of page D10.•Encourage patient to keep track of situations where relaxation skills can beapplied. This can guide relaxation goal setting.•Continue to the goal setting and action planning worksheet if you will not becovering imagery in session.Page D10 of the patient workbook. How to practice deep breathing describes how to breathe more with your stomach and diaphragm rather than your chest. It gives instructions for how to deep breathe and resources for more information.Page D11 of the patient workbook. These instructions for practice exercises describe how the changing the patient's experience of stress is like learning a new skill. With regular practice, such as three five-minute sessions a day, it will get easier.Clinician Tips: 1)Posture: The easiest way to learn and practice deep breathing is in a lying position.However, this is not always practical, and some body positions make it  difficultto practice deep breathing. You might recommend the opposite of “standing atattention” - lowering the  shoulders and letting them slouch forward slightly,leaning back into the  chair,  and relaxing the chest and abdomen muscles.2)Pulmonary Disease: Relaxation training, including diaphragmatic breathing, is standardin many pulmonary rehabilitation programs, as it can increase oxygen saturation,decrease respiratory rate, and decrease dyspnea. However, some patients withobstructive airway diseases may experience dyspnea or discomfort when air is trappedor not properly expelled from the lungs. Consider the  patient’s preferences whenengaging in deep-breathing exercises. Some patients with pulmonary disease may preferto focus on guided imagery as an alternative form of relaxation.6.(Imagery) Use imagery to reduce stress and tension.Refer to workbook, page D12,  “Using Imagery to Reduce Stress & Tension.”A.Introduce imagery and review information about the skill.•Discuss how imagery works to relieve stress andtension.Page D12 of the patient manual. Using imagery to reduce stress and tension defines what imagery is and how it is used.Refer to workbook, page D13, “How to Practice Using Imagery.” B.Instruct the patient in how to practice imagery exercises.•Have patient find a comfortable position.•Have patient rate his/her level of  tension on a1-10 scale before practicing deep breathing.•Find a specific scene; it can be either one thepatient selects or one of the specific examplescripts (pgs. 68-70.).•Guide the patient through a guided imageryexercise.•After practicing, process the experience with thepatient:•Ask the patient to indicate whether he/she notices feeling any more relaxed.•Ask for any general feedback about how this skill seemed to work.Page D13 of the patient workbook. How to practice using imagery gives instructions, examples, and exercises for practing imagery.Refer to workbook, page D17, “Instructions for Practice Exercises.” C.Review instructions for practicing at home.•Discuss different imagery scene possibilities for home practice.•Stress the importance of mastering the technique before applying it in stressfulsituations.•Encourage patient to keep track of situations where relaxation skills can be ap-plied. This can guide relaxation goal setting.Page D17 of the patient workbook. This page gives instructions for completing practice exercises at home.7.Develop an action plan for next session.Refer to workbook, page  D19, “Action Plan.” Using the relaxation skill(s) that the patient has selected, develop an action plan that is a realistic  first step toward improving their management of stress and tension .  •Remind the patient to define their goal in terms of SMART guidelines.•Encourage the patient to monitor their progress implementing the action plan(see “tracking progress” section at the bottom of the page).This is the action plan worksheet from page D19 of the patient workbook. It provides the following prompts: The specific goal or activity I plan to work on, timeline for completing the goal, steps to help me accomplish my goal, possible barriers and ways to overcome them, how important is this gooal to you, how likely are you to complete these steps, what progress did you make on your goal this week, what went well, and what challenges came up.Clinician Tip: Ensuring positive reinforcement for the first action plan. Success with the first action plan will encourage the Veteran to engage  in treatment and skill usage. Work with the Veteran to identify one or two  situations where       relaxation skills are likely to be helpful. Encourage the patient to practice the       relaxation techniques and develop familiarity with them before applying them . This page intentionally left blank Improving health and wellness provider manual This page intentionally left blank Rationale for Incorporating Health & Wellness in CBT Background •Patients seen in nontraditional mental health settings (e.g., primary care andcommunity-based outpatient clinics) often have concerns (e.g., stigma) or negativeexpectations about mental health treatment expectations that make engaging incare difficult.•Patients seen in these “medical care” settings often prefer their mental health careto include elements that link directly to their physical health.•Clinicians have the option to align with the patient’s overall health and wellness byinitially  focusing on physical health and then transitioning into more traditionalmental health intervention efforts.Module Rationale •The purpose of the Improving Health and Wellness skill module is to engagepatients who wish to begin treatment by talking about physical health concerns.•The skills included in the module are closely aligned to common health concernsincluding weight and eating behaviors, physical activities and exercise, improvingsleep, and managing pain. The content is consistent with a general cognitivebehavioral approach of focusing on skills and goal setting related to behavioralactivation, relaxation, and reducing maladaptive thinking.When to use / not use  this module Clinicians are most likely to use this module during the initial stages of treatment to      engage patients in the broader bCBT approach. Although the content focuses on health and well- being, the processes and strategies broadly apply to patient behavioral and     cognitive skill development, which should help patients feel more comfortable with the “core” CBT for depression skills (cognitive, behavioral, and relaxation). This module was NOT developed to be the sole focus of treatment. Although improving physical health and well-being may indirectly improve depression, this is not      considered a “core” element of CBT for depression. These skills were intended to help patients transition into the more traditional “core” elements of CBT for depression; namely behavioral activation, reducing maladaptive thinking patterns, and increasing relaxation.  In conclusion, clinicians are encouraged to use the Health and Wellness module for one or possibly two sessions, but then transition to other modules that address depression more directly. This page intentionally left blank Session checklist: Session Roadmap and Check-in 1.Establish a session roadmap (agenda) with the patient2.Complete a mood “check-in” using the PHQ-93.Review the previous session’s assignment and any other ongoing skills beingused by the patientDeveloping New Skills – Improving Health and Wellness 4.Briefly review the different health and wellness areas included in this session.Areas include: Healthy Eating, Physical Activities/ Exercise, Improving Sleep,and Overcoming Pain.5.Explore how Dave used the Improving Health and Wellness session to addresshis pain and healthy eating goals.6.Identify the area(s) of health and wellness that the patient wants to improve.7.Use the tip sheets to identify patient-centered health and wellness skills.8.Develop an action plan for next session.Provider Manual Key: Refers to workbook page Provider Tips Session Roadmap & Check-in 1.Establish the roadmap (set the agenda).Refer to workbook, page E3, “What to Expect in this Session.” Review the session roadmap with the patient (in the patient workbook). This is page E3 of the patient workbook. This session roadmap describes what will happen during the session, including setting an agenda, doing a mood check, and reviewing the previous session's assignment. It also discusses improving health and wellness.2.Complete a Mood Check-in (Administer the PHQ-9).Refer to workbook, page E4, “Rate Your Mood.” A.Administer the PHQ-9 and review the responses.•Record the responses in the CPRS note templateB.Provide feedback to the patient about his/herdepression status.•PHQ-9 Scoring:0-4 = minimal depression5-9 = mild depression10-14 = moderate depression15-19 = moderately severe depression20+ = severe depression C.For patients entering their third treatment sessionor later—explore and discuss patient treatmentresponse, where appropriate.•Measurement-based treatment response definition: PHQ-9 Total score below 10 OR50% reduction in symptoms.A copy of the PHQ-9 on page E4 of the patient workbook. It asks the patient to respond to a list of 9 questions about feelings and thoughts and how often they have been bothered by them in the last two weeks.Clinician Tips: Depression Assessment & Patient Feedback 1)Communicate depression results to your patients and encourage them to activelymonitor their depression symptoms. Patient awareness is an important first steptowards change.2)Use thoughtful and effective language for communicating depression symptom feedback.Patients will benefit from accurate but encouraging feedback using language they canunderstand. For example, when communicating PHQ-9 results that fall in the moderatelysevere or severe range – you may wish to use the term high rather than severe.3)Consider discussing treatment progress related to any changes in depression total scoreor specific depression items. Reinforcing positive change is important – change mayoccur in total score or specific depression symptoms, depending on the focus in the priorsession(s).4)Addressing negative change is often patient-specific. However, it should also beaddressed with   encouragement and continued practice, and by exploring treatmentoptions both within and beyond bCBT.3.Review previous session’s home practice goal and action plan.Refer to their prior week’s action plan sheet A.ACTION PLAN—NEXT STEPS•Discuss the prior week’s action plan with the patient. For example – ask aboutprogress towards the goal (exceeded, met, partially met, did not attempt).Explore what went well and any challenges.•Re-evaluate goal moving forward (continue, modify, discontinue)B.ACTION PLAN—OTHER SKILLS•Revisit any other skills (e.g. prior action plans) being used by the patient. Brieflyreview these skills and how they are being used. Problem-solve where appropriateand support continued skill use.Prior week’s action plan (front) This is the front of the prior week's action plan worksheet from the patient workbook. It provides the following prompts: The specific goal or activity I plan to work on, timeline for completing the goal, steps to help me accomplish my goal, possible barriers and ways to overcome them, how important is this gooal to you, how likely are you to complete these steps, what progress did you make on your goal this week, what went well, and what challenges came up.Prior week’s action plan (back) This is the back of the prior week's action plan worksheet from the patient workbook. It provides the following prompts: next steps for the plan, and other skills to work on.Clinician Tips: Homework / Action Plan Progress 1)The main reason for reviewing action plan progress is to encourage and help thepatient problem solve to use skills more effectively. Get creative and follow the interestsof the patient in making skills work and modifying skills for future use.2)For patients who are able to easily acquire a specific skill (e.g. accomplish a goal) –consider exploring additional uses or broader applications of the skill. For example,using a relaxation strategy for pain management or sleep – or using a cognitive strategyfor a new area in the patient’s life.3)For patients who are struggling to complete an action plan – consider reviewing theinitial goal and the patient’s interest in the goal. Modifications might involve breaking theaction plan down into more manageable steps or changing to a new skill.Developing New Skills 4.Provide a brief rationale and review of skills included in this session.Refer to workbook, page E5, “Physical Health.” A.Provide a rationale to encourage the patient and structure in-session work.•Emphasize that multiple interrelated factors contribute to physical health, andthat some of these can be influenced by behavioral/lifestyle changes.B.Review the health and wellness areas.•Ask patient to start thinking about which primary area they would like  to startwith.Page E5 of the patient workbook. Physical Health describes healthy eating, physical activity and exercise, improving sleep, and overcoming pain.Clinician Tips: Reviewing the Physical Health Areas of Focus 1)The key here is to orient the patient to the general domains covered in the session.2)The patient does NOT need to select his/her most salient issue at this time(this occurs in section 6).5.Explore how Dave used the  session to address his pain/healthy eating goals.Refer to workbook, pages E6 & E7; “Dave & Pain/Healthy Eating.” A.Use the first example of Dave to help explain theemotional, behavioral, and cognitive elements of hisPAIN.Page E6 of the patient workbook. This page uses Dave as an example to talk about his constant pain from a back injury. Dave feels frustrated, down, unmotivated, unproductive, tired, and stress out about finances becasue of this pain. He oversleeps, watches a lot of TV, and hasn't cleaned his house in some time. He thinks his pain controls everything in his life and that he can't change anything. He used the pain tip sheet to create a three-pronged approach to become more physically active, shift the way he thinks about his pain, and use deep breathing.B.Use the second example of Dave to help explain theemotional, behavioral, and cognitive elementsrelated to his healthy eating goals.Page E7 of the patient manual. This page uses Dave as an example to explore healthy eating. Dave gained 25 pounds over the past year. He feels embarassed, ashamed, and overwhelmed because of this. He eats a lot of fast food and doesn't do much physically. Dave used the healthy eating tip sheet to improve his nutrition and plan for success.Clinician Tips: Using the case example of Dave 1)Use the case examples to educate the patient on how thoughts, feelings, and behaviorsrelate to physical health and physical health skill use. If the patient is alreadyknowledgeable and/or quickly understands these principles, you are encouraged tosummarize the case examples rather than walking through the specifics.2)The case of Dave includes a description of skill use. Skills will not be covered at this timebut later in the session. The skill listing is provided for example purposes only so thepatient can see the relationship between the exercise and eventual skill selection anduse.6.Identify the area(s) of health and wellness that the patient wants to improve.•Areas include: Healthy Eating, Physical Activities / Exercise, Improving Sleep,and Overcoming Pain.•When necessary, clinicians may wish to direct the patient back to page E5 of theworkbook to review the areas.Clinician Tip: Identifying a Focus of Treatment 1)Attempt to find the most salient physical health concern, and focus on it first. Ifadditional areas are of interest to the patient – let him/her know that you canrevisit those after you work through his/her most pressing concern first.2)When in doubt – attempt to have the patient focus on a physical health skill areathat is likely to benefit the patient in the near future. Early success in treatment isimportant. For more  information, please see the goal setting and action plantraining section on the website.7.Work to identify patient-centered health and wellness skills.Refer to workbook, page E8, “Improving Your Physical Health.” A.Walk the patient through this worksheet to identify the emotional, behavioral, andcognitive elements related to the patient’s primary physical health concern.•Complete icons #1 through #4 on theworksheet in collaboration with thepatient. This worksheet includes:1)The physical health concern bubble2)Mood, thoughts, and behavioral impact3)What the patient has tried in the past.•Summarize icons #1 through 4 withstatements that highlight the importantemotional, behavioral, and cognitiveinfluences on the patient’s overall healthand wellness.Page E8 of the patient workbook. This page is a worksheet for improving the patient's physical health. It has prompts for the patient to enter how they feel, what they are doing, their thoughts, and using skills or tools to cope.Clinician Tip: Completing the Health and Wellness Worksheet 1)Pay close attention to the cognitive, behavioral, and emotional elements in thisworksheet to help the patient to later transition into the core brief CBT skills.2)Some patients may find this exercise complicated and/or difficult. You areencouraged to help the patient by asking focused or directive questions. You shouldalso be flexible in “letting go” of elements that may be of secondary importance orprove particularly difficult for the patient. For   example, some patients may havedifficulty identifying thoughts associated with their physical health concern(s) buteasily identify behaviors and emotions. You may wish to spend less time with thecognitive elements and focus in on other elements that provide opportunities forintervention and are in line with the comfort of the patient.Refer to Tip Sheets in workbook, pages E10-E14. B.Review the selected tip sheet with the patient.•Collaboratively explore skills / strategiesthat best fit the patient’s needs andinterests.•Guide the patient towards tips that willaddress his/her most pressing cognitive,behavioral, and emotional concerns (asidentified during the “Improving YourPhysical Health” Worksheet).•Select one or two strategies that can bedeveloped into an action plan (next step).The patient is NOT expected to do all ofthese activities.C.List the tips he/she  identified in the toolbox section of the patient’s worksheets onpage E8-E9.Page E10 of the patient workbook. This healthy eating tips sheet describes ways to improve nutrition and planning for success through things like finding healthy recipes, identifying an eating plan, and planning ahead. It also shows a healthy eating plate.Clinician Tip: Selecting Skills from the Tip Sheets 1)Skill selection MUST be collaborative to ensure patient buy-in and motivation.An activated and  empowered patient is much more likely to benefit from thetreatment. Selection of skills is a critical opportunity to empower.2)Skills that have the potential to be rapidly and easily used are the best to beginwith. Similarly, if a skill has multiple points of impact (behavioral, cognitive, orrelaxation), the chances of success and use of the skill go up. For example, a skilllike exercise (e.g., walking for 20 minutes three times per week) may improvephysical functioning but may also reduce depression through behavioral activation,may improve thinking patterns (e.g., increased efficacy and sense ofaccomplishment), and may help the patient to relax or even sleep better.8.Develop an action plan for next session.Refer to workbook, page  E15, “Action Plan.” Help the patient formulate an action plan for one or more of the tips identified on workbook page E8. Develop a plan that is a realistic first step toward improving their health-related behavior in that area.  •Remind the patient to define their goal in terms of SMART guidelines.•Encourage the patient to monitor their progress implementing the action plan(see “tracking progress” section at the bottom of the page).This is the action plan worksheet from page E15 of the patient workbook. It provides the following prompts: The specific goal or activity I plan to work on, timeline for completing the goal, steps to help me accomplish my goal, possible barriers and ways to overcome them, how important is this gooal to you, how likely are you to complete these steps, what progress did you make on your goal this week, what went well, and what challenges came up.Clinician Tip: Ensuring positive reinforcement for the first action plan. Success with the first action plan will encourage the Veteran to maintain healthy  behaviors. Work with the Veteran to identify one or two of the tips that he/she is  likely to complete and that are likely to enhance self-efficacy.  Final session provider manual This page intentionally left blank Rationale for a Final Session The purpose of the Final Session is to assist patients with: •Recognizing change over the course of treatment, including attributions of thischange•Identifying ways to maintain this change•Creating a plan for continued health and well-beingThe final session includes a collaborative review of treatment progress, including changes in PHQ-9 scores, patient report, and goal attainment. The final session      attempts to maximize treatment success by  anticipating and addressing possible barriers to ongoing skill use, goal attainment, and symptom reduction.  •Special attention should be paid to reviewing the “core” elements of CBT fordepression that were delivered during this program (i.e., behavioral activation,reducing maladaptive thinking patterns).•Encourage patients to continue to continue applying these foundationaldepression management skills to new problems or situations after thetermination of treatment.Before a Final Session The Final Session is a way to collaboratively and thoughtfully engage patients in their treatment. This includes collaborating with patients to decide when to terminate the program, based on both patient and provider impressions of progress. This flexible process also allows for additional bCBT sessions (up to nine sessions as indicated) and/or additional services following the bCBT program. •Discuss treatment ending prior to the last session. Ending treatment is a process,even in the context of brief treatment.•Consider overall treatment progress in deciding when to end treatment. The FinalSession allows for a “big picture” look at the participant’s progress and challengesduring treatment and provides support for maintaining this progress.•Treatment wrap-up is variable and up to the clinician and the patient. Althoughstandard bCBT treatment is six sessions, providers may extend bCBT treatment upto  nine sessions.•Clinicians are encouraged to refer to the additional training on Treatment LengthConsiderations to inform the duration of treatment with participants in thisprogram.This page intentionally left blank Session checklist: Session Roadmap: Final Session 1.Establish a session roadmap (agenda) with the patient.2.Complete a mood “check-in” using the PHQ-9.3.Review the previous session’s assignment and any other ongoing skills beingused by the patient.4.Review patient’s progress over the course of treatment, including goalattainment and overall mood.5.Introduce and discuss the tip sheet for maintaining progress, includingreview of anticipated barriers.6.Discuss when to seek follow-up treatment, including crisis referral7.Wrap-up and close.Provider Manual Key: Refers to workbook page Provider Tips Session Roadmap & Check-in 1.Establish the roadmap (set the agenda).Refer to workbook, page F3, “What to Expect in this Session.” Review the session roadmap with the patient (in the patient workbook). This is page F3 of the patient workbook.

It provides the following prompts: next steps for the plan, and other skills to work on.Clinician Tips: Homework / Action Plan Progress 1)The main reason for reviewing action plan progress is to encourage and help thepatient problem solve to use skills more effectively. Get creative and follow the interestsof the patient in making skills work and modifying skills for future use.2)For patients who are able to easily acquire a specific skill (e.g. accomplish a goal) –consider exploring additional uses or broader applications of the skill.

Modifications might involve breaking theaction plan down into more manageable steps or changing to a new skill.4.Review patient’s progress over treatment.Refer to workbook, page F5, “Progress Review.” Use the “Progress Review” worksheet to review patient progress over the course of treatment. Focus discussion first on the patient’s treatment progress, then on his/her  attributions for the changes identified. A.Summarize PHQ-9 scores over the course of treatment, as deemed clinically useful.The PHQ-9 can be used as a tool to communicate changes in depression symptomseverity/frequency and for discussing patient progress and further referral options(for non-responsive or worsening PHQ-9 scores).•Program treatment response is defined as:  PHQ-9 total score < 10 or a 50%reduction in PHQ-9 score.B.Elicit patient’s perception of success during treatment regarding goalattainment and use of bCBT skills. Assess what change the patient has noticed,including broader improvements such as quality of life or relationships.•If a patient accurately identifies his/her progress during treatment, you areencouraged to reinforce this progress and elicit patient examples of progress/improvement. You may also offer a summary of the changes demonstrated intreatment. Ideally, the provider will link this to the previous discussion of PHQ-9scores and mood over treatment. Then, you may continue to step C.•If a patient has difficulty identifying his/herprogress, you are encouraged to take amore directive stance in assisting thepatient with identifying change duringtreatment.Page F5 of the patient workbook. This progress review sheet asks the patient to rate their overall sucess in reaching their goals, check off what areas of their lives have changed, and fill in what contributed to this change.C.The next focus of inquiry is identifying attributions for this change over treatment.Assist patients in identifying their role in any progress—what actions and skillshelped them with this success? Identifying change and attributing the mechanismsof change will likely require your assistance.•Ask “What contributed to this change [noted in previous discussion]?•Does the patient attribute his/her progress to his/her own actions? If a patientaccurately attributes treatment progress to his/her own actions, you areencouraged to reinforce this and again elicit patient examples of how he/sheenacted change.•If a patient has difficulty attributing treatment progress to his/her own actions,you are again encouraged to be directive and disclose observations of thepatient over the course of treatment.Clinician Tips: Reviewing Progress 1)Help patients give themselves credit—the key here is for patients to accuratelyidentify progress and attribute such progress to their own actions.  You are en-couraged to take an active and directive approach when reviewing treatment pro-gress, particularly with patients who struggle to see any progress or change.2)If a patient rates his/her progress as partially successful, compare it to another,lower anchor: Why partially successful and not unsuccessful? This can open thedoor to discussing change and helping the patient recognize areas of improve-ment.3)Focus on the patient’s improvement, however small, by sharing reflections of pro-gress throughout treatment. For example, a patient  might rate his/her progress asvery low, in which case you may assist the patient in finding small but importantareas in which he/she did make progress—even if that means attending sessionregularly!4)It is also crucial that the patient attribute this progress to his/her actions and en-gagement in treatment. Many patients may need guidance and directions from youin making this connection—so don’t be afraid to be bold!5.Review tips for maintaining improvement/discuss maintaining progress.Refer to workbook, pages F6 & F7, “Maintaining Improvement” and “Next Steps.” A.Transition to discussing “next steps” with the patient now that treatment is ending.•Discuss ways to maintain treatment gains, using the “Maintaining Improvement”tip sheet as a guide to conversation. This includes both tips for maintaining im-provement as well as tips for addressing set-backs.Page F6 of the patient manual. This maintaining improvement sheet provides tips for maintaining improvement, like remaining socially connected, sharing your progress with someone, and set reasonable goals. It also describes some bumps in the road, like anticipating and addressing barriers to goals.B.Collaborate with the patient to complete the “Next Steps” worksheet as part of thisdiscussion of maintaining improvement.•Discuss the patient’s ongoing goals—thesecan be specific (e.g., continue practicingrelaxation techniques daily before bed) orbroad (e.g., increase my social engagement).•Assist patient in creating a general action planfor achieving future goals, with particularemphasis on skills taught in bCBT. Finally,guide the patient in identifying obstacles tohis/her goals and problem-solve accordingly.•Refer back to the “Maintaining Improvement”tip sheet as needed.Page F7 of the patient workbook. This next steps worksheet asks the patients to identify their goals moving forward, the steps they can take to achieve their goals, who can help them move forward, what might stand in the way, and how they plan to overcome those obstacles.Clinician Tip: Maintaining Improvement 1)Engage patient in ways he/she can continue to improve. Follow his/her lead! Socialconnections and continued use of bCBT skills (including self-monitoring) are likelyto be important.2)Anticipate “bumps in the road” once bCBT has ended. There are likely to be twotypes of  stressors—those that are expected and those that are unexpected. Use theTip Sheet to facilitate this discussion.3)In addition, normalize setbacks for the patient, including the chance of depressivesymptoms returning or worsening.4)Patient may need assistance brainstorming possible barriers—have some commonones identified (e.g., time, money, worsening of depressive symptoms, motivation).5)Encourage patient to think about the generalizability of bCBT skills and how thesemight be  flexibly adapted to new stressors and situations.6.Discuss when to seek follow-up treatment and provide crisis referral.Refer to workbook, page F8, “Additional Help.” A.Assist the patient in completing the top portion of the worksheet. Encourage thepatient to write down signs and symptoms that his/her depressive symptoms arereturning or worsening. This will serve as a resource to identify when to seekadditional help after the discontinuation of bCBT treatment.B.Direct the patient that he/she can access behavioral health care at a later date bycontacting his/her mental health care provider. If the patient does not have amental health care provider, refer the patient to his/her VA primary care providerto access care. Finally, point out the Veterans’ Crisis Line contact information.Page F8 of the patient workbook. This additional help worksheet asks the patient to identify signs they should seek additional help and provides options for seeking additional help, such as the Veterans' Crisis Line.Clinician Tip: Ensuring plan for continuation of treatment as needed. Assisting the Veteran to proactively identify signs that he/she may need additional services makes it more likely that he/she will engage in treatment when needed. Work with the Veteran to identify symptoms and signs that he/she was experiencing at the beginning of the bCBT program, and use this as a framework for early detection of the return or worsening of depressive symptoms in the future. 7.Close session.Refer to workbook, page F9, “Finish Line.” Congratulate the patient on completing the bCBT program, and thank him/her for  participating. page F9 of the patient workbook. It has a picture of a person crossing a finish line at the end of a race.Measurement-based Care and Treatment Duration Provider Manual This page intentionally left blank Measurement-Based Care What is Measurement-Based Care? Measurement based care (MBC) entails using data to monitor treatment outcomes  (or response) over time and to use these data to inform care decisions. Example: Psychiatrist administers PHQ-9 at each treatment visit (every 4-6 weeks) to monitor response to an antidepressant medication. Data from the PHQ-9 are used to inform dose titration, medication switch, or to change/add treatments. Why Use Measurement-Based Care? Measurement based care (MBC) is important for determining the effectiveness of a  given treatment. In addition to providing information, MBC serves several key      functions for improving the quality and impact of psychotherapy:  1.MBC is a core component of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).MBC is a foundational element of CBT, which uses patient self-report inventories toassess change in outcomes related to depression, anxiety, anger, etc. CBT uses astructured approach with routine assessment of symptoms and progress towardgoals to inform treatment. Thus, MBC is a natural fit with the current brief CBTprotocol.2.MBC improves intervention outcomes.Research has shown that systematically monitoring depressive symptoms canimprove treatment outcomes in specialty mental health (Knaup, et al., 2009;Lambert, et al. 2002) and primary care settings (Yeung, et al. 2012). Theseimprovements are above and beyond standard interventions that do not use MBC.Therefore, MBC is an intervention in and of itself. MBC improves outcomes byinforming treatment decisions.3.MBC can help to identify non-responders.MBC helps to assess whether or not a given treatment is working for the patient.This may inform a decision to continue treatment with careful monitoring, changethe focus of treatment (e.g. change of skill module, goal, or action planningexercises), add a treatment (medications, medical treatment, spiritual referral), orin some cases, discontinue the primary treatment.4.MBC can help detect residual symptoms.MBC can help identify symptoms that remain even during effective treatment (e.g.,depressed mood has remitted but sleep patterns remain disrupted). Identificationof these residual symptoms can help clinicians and patients to more effectivelyidentify skills to address these problem areas. It may also help patients to targetand prepare for future difficulties.5.MBC can help increase patient engagement in treatment.The use of regular symptom monitoring including feedback and discussion with thepatient is a meaningful way to include the patient in the treatment process. Engagedpatients are much more likely to benefit from psychotherapy. This engagement alsohelps to crystallize common treatment goals between the patient and therapist.Transparency is key and MBC helps to improve treatment communication betweenthe therapist and patient.6.MBC can help patients recognize change.Often patients discount their progress and their contributions to positivetherapeutic change. By documenting change, clinicians are in a better position toshow “tangible evidence” of improvement. Clinicians can take this a step further byexploring the reasons for change with the patient to highlight the patient’scontributions and efforts to realize this change. This process can be critical tobuilding self-confidence and post treatment planning (e.g. the patient has the skillsto maintain progress).How do Clinicians Use Measurement Based Care in the Brief CBT Project? The current Brief CBT project will use the PHQ-9 to regularly assess for depression. •Clinicians are asked to use the PHQ-9 during each session as part of a brief moodcheck-in with the patient.•PHQ-9 will be used to inform care decisions – especially related to treatmentending / treatment response.•The brief CBT project team has created a CPRS note template with the PHQ-9embedded to facilitate documentation of the PHQ-9.•The PHQ-9 may be administered manually using the session note pages includedin the abbreviated provider manual.Why the PHQ-9? •It is the depression measure of choice in the VHA.•It is psychometrically strong.•It provides clinically useful data on symptoms and diagnosis.•It is practical for frontline practice.Practical Tips for Using Measurement-Based Care: •Build MBC (the PHQ-9) into your standard practice by creating routines.•We recommend using the PHQ-9 at every visit and discussing the results withthe patient as a foundational piece for each session.•Use the CPRS template provided to increase ease of use, guide administration,and chart the patient’s progress. The CPRS note will graphically display the pa-tient’s last three PHQ-9 total scores over time. However, you may want to trackindividual symptoms over time to show specific impact or change – especially ifthe patient’s overall PHQ-9 score is relatively stable.•The use of paper format administration is available using the abbreviatedclinician manual (not required).•Use the PHQ-9 to reinforce patient progress and to identify residual symptoms.Adjust treatment accordingly by selecting goals and focused skill modules toaddress specific issues or symptoms.Treatment Duration General guidelines for determining treatment length: You can expect  variation in each patient’s clinical presentation (e.g. depression       severity, mental / physical health complexity, social support, etc.) and preferences and/or availability for treatment. Given this, we cannot specify an exact length of   treatment that will fit the needs of each patient. However, evidence suggests that brief psychotherapies such as CBT can be effective in as few as 2-3 sessions with many      patients showing response by 4-6 sessions. That said, some patients may progress more slowly and may benefit from a few additional sessions beyond a normal course of treatment. The brief CBT for depression program uses a variable treatment intensity to allow providers and patients to determine treatment length. During the development and testing of the brief CBT for depression intervention, re-sponse was defined as a PHQ-9 reduction of 50%. Example PHQ-9 targets include: PHQ-9 At Treatment Initiation 26 24 22 20 (Severe) 18 16 (15 = Moderately Severe) 14 12 10 (Moderate) PHQ-9 Response Target 13 12 11 10 (moderate) 9 8 7 6 5 (Mild) Determination of treatment length should be based on clinical evidence, but more      importantly within a collaborative relationship between the provider and patient. The following sections provide considerations for determining treatment length: Patient is not appropriate for brief CBT. Despite our best efforts to select appropriate treatments for individual patients, it may occur during treatment that brief CBT is not appropriate for the needs of a given       patient. A provider may identify serious mental, physical, or social/contextual factors that require focused attention. For example, a provider may identify serious substance abuse issues that require immediate attention. In such cases it is imperative that       providers discontinue brief CBT (where appropriate) and place effective referrals to address the most pressing needs of the Veteran. Patient has partially responded to regular course (e.g. 4-6 sessions) of brief CBT. Partial responders are patients  who have not achieved their stated goals or have       reduced depressive symptoms but remain at a moderate to high level of distress. In such cases, the provider should weigh the pros and cons related to the following      options:  .) Continue brief CBT up to 9 sessions if the patient is making progress and is   engaged in the process.  This option also provides better continuity of care in that the patient will not be forced to develop a new relationship with a new     therapist.  .) Referral to a new provider who can deliver more intensive depression services. This option is obviously contingent upon availability of such services and may or may not involve a delay or interruption in care.  Ideally, a brief CBT therapist would remain in contact with the patient during the transition process to ensure continuity for the Veteran.   .) Prescribe an active period of watchful waiting where the brief CBT therapist may take a case management approach (e.g. following up by telephone on a monthly basis). Case management sessions may include depression symptom checkups but also to assess whether the patient is interested in discontinuing follow up or alternatively ready to engage in a more intensive course of treatment. Partial response decision making is highly related to your local clinical setting, clinical procedures, and availability of services.  Brief CBT is flexible and should always be      delivered within the larger clinical context. Patient has rapidly responded to brief CBT (e.g. within 1-2 sessions). Some patients may demonstrate rapid improvements after beginning treatment.      Ideally, brief CBT should include no fewer than three sessions even for rapid      responders. Three sessions allow the provider to more fully assess the stability of       depression symptoms. Even if stable, a second or third session allows the provider to work with the patient on matters related to maintaining change and how to prepare for symptom re-occurrence and steps to take if symptoms do in fact return.   Contact Information Please contact the project coordinators if you have any technical issues or procedural questions: Darrell Zeno: Darrell.Zeno@va.gov 713-791-1414 x10367Direct line: 713-440-4492 Andrew Robinson: Andrew.Robinson@va.gov 713-791-1414 x10262Please contact your training mentor if you have any questions or concerns related to mentoring or seeing your patients:  Jeffrey Cully, PhD Jeffrey.Cully@va.gov (713)794-8526Joe Mignogna, PhD Joseph.Mignogna@va.gov (405)269-6866Derrecka Boykin, PhD Derrecka.Boykin@va.gov (713)791-1414 x10403
