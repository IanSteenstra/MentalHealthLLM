The original manual consisted of a group intervention model for adults with depression.  This intervention was used with adult Hispanic populations in the San Francisco area.  The main aims of this intervention are to decrease depressive symptoms, shorten the time the adolescent is depressed, learn new ways to prevent becoming depressed and feel more in control.   The original manual was subjected to various changes in order to adapt it for use with Puerto Rican adolescents.  To this end, the following changes were made:  (1) The group format was adapted to an individual treatment modality.  In this manner, the therapy focuses more on the adolescents’ problems and uses their thoughts, experiences, actions, and relationships as examples of the material to be presented.  This makes for a more dynamic and interactive therapy, thus allowing the adolescent to assume a more active role.  (2) The original manual referred to the participants in the formal second person voice "usted".  The formal "usted" was substituted for the familiar second person voice "tu" in order to eliminate the interpersonal distance associated with "usted" in a youth population.  (3) The language was simplified to make it more accessible to adolescents.  For example, the word "nullity" was substituted for the phrase "I am nothing."  (4) The examples were substituted, broadened, or complemented by situations that have arisen in our work with Puerto Rican adolescents.  (5) Some of the content was adapted to Puerto Rican culture.  (6) Many adolescents are resistant to completing assignments or tasks.  For this reason, the manual format is more flexible.  Therefore, the therapist has two choices: talk about the adolescent’s thoughts about the assignment, and/or complete the assignment at the beginning of the therapy session.  These tasks or exercises were called personal projects.  (7) The therapist meets the adolescent and his/her parent(s) before the therapeutic process begins.  This creates an open session to establish rapport with the adolescent and explore in detail his/her condition.  This manual was used as part of a research project on the treatment of depression in Puerto Rican adolescents sponsored by the National Institute for Mental Health (NIMH) and the Institutional Funds for Research (FIPI, in Spanish) of the University of Puerto Rico.  This adapted Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) manual has been used in three clinical trials where it has been efficacious in treating depression in Puerto Rican adolescents (Rosselló & Bernal, 1996; 1999; 2005; Rosselló, Bernal & Rivera, in press).   After the original adaptation in the first clinical trial, the manual has continuously been refined based on our experiences with its use with Puerto Rican adolescents. Examples have been added based on real experiences that adolescents have brought up in therapy. More detailed instructions for therapists have been provided to facilitate the use of the techniques described in the manual. We also developed a manual for the participants’ that summarizes the main points from each session as well as worksheets to be used in-session and in between sessions.     Cognitive-behavioral therapy for the treatment of depression   Research studies carried out during the last decades have consistently shown that CBT is efficacious in treating adolescent mental disorders such as depression, anxiety or oppositional defiant disorders (Bedrosian, 1981; Block, 1978; Barber & DeRubies, 1989; Clarke, Lewinsohn & Hops, 1990; Compton et al., 2004; DiGuiseppe, 1988; Melvin et al., 2006; Schrodt & Wright, 1986; Schrodt & Fitzgerald, 1987; Snyder & White, 1979; Weisz, McCarty, & Valeri, 2004; Zarb, 1992).  Most therapeutic interventions used with adolescents are the result of adaptations of interventions used with adults.   Cognitive-behavioral therapy is based on the interrelationship of thoughts, actions, and feelings.  In order to work with feelings of depression, this model establishes the importance of identifying the thoughts and actions that influence mood.  In this manner the adolescent learns to gain control of his/her feelings.  Therapy sessions are divided into three topics or modules that consist of four sessions each.  The first four sessions work on how thoughts influence mood.  The next four sessions discuss daily activities that affect mood.  The last four sessions address how interactions with others affect our mood.  A description of each module is provided below.    Module I: Thoughts (Sessions 1-4)  (How our THOUGHT affect our mood)  The main purpose of this module is to present information about how our thoughts influence our mood. The initial session establishes the structure and purpose of the subsequent sessions.  Also, the time and day of the sessions will be established as well as rules for therapy and limits of confidentiality. It is important that participants are clear on the limits and scope of confidentiality since this can have an effect on the type and quality of the therapeutic relationship.   The first session begins a dialogue on depression: what it is and how the participant experiences it. The therapist also presents the purpose of the first module, which is to understand how our thoughts influence our mood.  Thoughts are defined in this session.  The next three sessions work with different types of thinking errors and dysfunctional thoughts associated with depression, as well as how they can be debated and modified to improve our mood. In-session exercises are used to identify thinking errors. The design of the third session meets the purpose of providing the participant with strategies for increasing positive thoughts and decreasing unhealthy or dysfunctional negative thoughts, and thus, decreasing depressive symptoms.        Module II: Activities (Sessions 5-8) (How our ACTIVITIES affect our mood)  The sessions in this module allow the participant to associate participation in pleasant activities with depressive symptoms. There is a discussion on how the presence of depression can limit participation in pleasant activities, which in turn, increases depressive symptoms.   During these sessions, pleasant activities are defined and obstacles for engaging in them are identified. This module also works with how learning to establish clear goals can help decrease depression.  Steps in establishing reachable goals are taught and practiced in session.  The main purpose of this module is that the participant increase his/her control over his/her life and learn to identify alternatives that will allow him/her to have more freedom and choices.  Together with the therapist, goals and activities are established that will help improve the participant’s mood.   Module III: Relationships (Sessions 9-12) (How our RELATIONSHIPS affect our mood)  The sessions in this module introduce the concept of how our relationships affect our mood.  Social support and how it helps us confront difficult situations is discussed. The participant learns to identify and strengthen their social support networks. The last sessions integrate themes from the previous modules. The therapist together with the participant examine how thoughts affect the activities, social support and relationships the participant engages in. Exercises are used to teach assertive communication skills that will help the participant establish healthy satisfying relationships.   The therapeutic process ends reconsidering and integrating the main themes of each module. During the final session, an evaluation of the therapy experience is carried out with the participant to identify strengths and successes achieved. Recommendations related to follow up and areas to continue working on are discussed with the participant and his/her parents   Instructions for therapists  Use this manual as a guide. It will be useful because it presents the fundamental areas you show focus on during sessions.  It also provides examples that will serve as guides when the adolescent doesn’t provide material to work with in session. Nonetheless, the situations that adolescents bring to therapy are the most useful to work with since they provide information that is relevant to their particular circumstances. On the other hand, it is important to point out that the content worked on in each session should be integrated or built upon in subsequent sessions.  It is essential to follow up on information related to the thoughts module since this is the foundation of CBT. We suggest that you become familiar with the manual and use your own personal style so that when you put it into practice you feel comfortable and confident.   Throughout the manual, instructions for the therapist are in italics. The names of worksheets are in bold and are placed at the end of each session in which they are used.  The Personal Project is always in a grey box at the end of each session – this is where homework is assigned for the week to be brought in to the next session.   CBT sessions are usually 50-60 minutes long. The first 15 minutes are used to review the Personal Project and the Mood Thermometer, as well as material from the previous session. Then the material for the session is presented and worked through, as well as material brought in by the adolescent. The final 5 minutes should be used to assign the Personal Project for the week.                                       References  Bedrosian, R. (1981).

Introduce yourself to the adolescent and his/her parents.  . Name, position, brief orientation on today’s session  2. Ask the parents:  . What worries you most about your son/daughter?  3. Explain the purpose of CBT treatment.  . To provide skills to manage depression.   4. Explain issues surrounding confidentiality and the nature of communication with parents.    . Explain to the parents and the adolescent how you will be maintaining confidential the information discussed during sessions. If there is information that you understand the parents need to know (whether because it represents a danger for the adolescent or other persons, or because it is necessary for the adolescent’s treatment), after discussing it with the adolescent you should share that information with the parents. If necessary, you can invite parents to a joint session with the adolescent.    . Explain that therapy sessions are for the adolescent, and that at the end of treatment, there will be a meeting with the parents to provide them with feedback on the adolescent’s participation in therapy and to offer recommendations if needed.   . If during the course of treatment, the parents feel that there is information that you should know (i.e. if symptoms are worsening, if the adolescent has expressed suicidal ideation, or if he/she has experienced a significant negative life event), then they should contact you by phone and/or arrive 5-10 minutes earlier that the programmed therapy session to discuss the situation.   5. Establish the day and time of therapy sessions.  . Underline the importance of punctuality and consistent attendance.  . Tell parents that it is important that they be at the clinic when the adolescent’s session is over.  . Inform them that sessions should only be cancelled in case of emergencies and if possible with 24 hours notice.  . Explain how this treatment has different educational and skill building components that follow a logical sequence based on weekly sessions and can be affected by frequent absences or lateness.  6. Provide the family with telephone numbers were they can reach you.  . Clinic phone numbers . Emergencies (therapist cell phone number)  7. Answer any questions the family might have.   8. On parents, reinforce the demonstrate interest in the child’s well-being and their supporting role in this process.           HOW YOUR THOUGHTS AFFECT YOUR MOOD (SESSION 1)  1. INTRODUCTION.  Introduce yourself sharing relevant personal  information. If the adolescent doesn’t respond you can share information similar to information you want the adolescent to share by modeling.   2. Encourage the adolescent to share personal information such as:  . Where he/she was born, information about his/her history or development . Things about his/her family  . The school he/she attends . What his/her  principal interests are (goals, likes and dislikes, hobbies) . Things about him/herself that they consider important  3. Ask about their main problems (for example, you can ask about worries or difficulties). You can also ask: “What would you like to change or improve about your life?”  4. Present the purpose of today’s session.   Today’s session has several goals:   . Get to know each other better . Discuss the rules for the sessions (see below) . Learn what depression is . Learn how your thoughts affect the way  you feel                    RULES FOR THERAPY SESSIONS  1. Arrive on time!  Be punctual!  2. Come every week!   This treatment is a commitment you make with yourself and your therapist.  3. Keep a positive attitude. 4. Do the Peronsal Proyects!  By practicing what you learn in these sessions, you can find out whether  these skills can help you control your symptoms of depression. 5. What you talk about in session is confidential.  However, it’s ok if you what to share what you’ve learned with other people if you want.  6. Try to be as honest as possible, and express yourself just as you are and how you feel.  7. Turn off your phone or put it on “vibrate” once you come into the therapy so it doesn’t interrupt the session.  5. The purpose of this session is to introduce you to the therapy in which you are going to participate.    The kind of skills we provide are called "COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY" o "Cognitive" refers to our thoughts. o "Behavioral" refers to our actions. o Depression has most to do with our feelings. By identifying thoughts and actions that affect our feelings, we can learn to gain more control over them and improve our mood (feel better).  Use this diagram How we understand depression to explain Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. There is a copy of this diagram in the participant’s manual and in Appendix A of this manual which you can reference when you provide the explanation.   HOW WE UNDERSTAND DEPRESSION            . This treatment for depression consists of 12 therapy sessions.  . We focus on what is going on in your life right now, in the present. . The therapy is focused on how to control depression in practical ways that can be used now and in the future.  The twelve sessions are divided into three modules or parts: - How your thoughts affect your mood. (4 sessions) - How your actions affect your mood. (4 sessions) - How your relationships affect your mood. (4 sessions)  In this type of treatment we try to teach people practical things they can use in their daily lives.  We expect that the most important effect of this treatment will be to learn to understand and manage the things that affect your mood (how you feel).   6. What is depression? What does it mean to be depressed?   Ask this question in a way that will encourage the adolescent to share information about his/her personal experience. Afterwards, share the following information trying to integrate the information the adolescent has shared.    The word depression is used in many ways.  Depression can mean:   - a feeling that lasts a few minutes  - a mood that lasts a few hours or a few days  - a clinical condition that:    - lasts for at least two weeks    - causes strong emotional suffering     - makes it difficult to carry out our daily activities  This treatment focuses on treating clinical depression.   7. Using the adolescents answers to the previous section, present the symptoms of clinical depression integrating symptoms that the adolescent has said he/she experiences. Ask if he/she has experiences any of the following symptoms.  People with clinical depression generally have five or more of the following symptoms:  . feeling depressed or down nearly every day . not being interested in things or unable to enjoy things you used to enjoy . appetite and/or weight change (eating more or less than you are used to) . sleeping problems (difficulties falling asleep, waking up often, waking up too early or being unable to fall back asleep, sleeping too much) . changes in how fast you move (either being too restless or moving very slow) . feeling tired all the time . feeling worthless or guilty . problems thinking, concentrating, or making decisions . thinking about death or hurting yourself (suicide)  8. The following questions can be used as a guide for a discussion con how cognitive-behavioral therapy can be applied to the adolescent’s particular experience o situation:  . What kinds of thoughts pass through your mind when you feel depressed or sad? . What do you do when you feel depressed? . How do you get along with others when you are depressed?   9.  Close this discussion on depression by reviewing how we understand depression. You should use the diagram – How we understand depression (Appendix A) – using information the adolescent has shared during the session.   10.  INTRODUCE THE CONCEPT OF HOW OUR THOUGHTS AFFECT OUR MOOD (HOW WE FEEL):   . Having certain types of thoughts can make you feel more or less depressed. By “thoughts” we mean “things that we tell ourselves.”  . Thoughts can have an effect on your body . Thoughts can have an effect on your actions (what you do) . Thoughts can have an effect on your mood (how you feel)      Provide a good example of how a thought can have an effect on your body, your actions and your mood.  o For example: You’re walking down a deserted street and you see a person walking quickly behind you. He looks serious, he is looking at you and you think that he is going to mug or rob you. Immediately, your body, your actions and your mood react to this thought. You start sweating, your heart races, and you feel a knot in your stomach. You start looking over your shoulder and walking faster. You feel nervous, afraid. The person reaches you, and quickly walks past you, getting farther and farther away. You think he was just in a hurry.   11. A good way to think about this type of therapy is that you will learn specific ways to change your thoughts and your actions so that you feel better.   12. Explain the purpose of therapy:    The purpose of this therapy is to treat depression by teaching your different ways to better control how you feel.  There are four goals we want to work towards:  1. To lessen or eliminate feelings of depression 2. To shorten the time you feel depressed 3. To learn ways to prevent or avoid getting depressed again 4. To feel more in control of your life            5.  CLOSURE AND DISCUSSION OF THE PERSONAL PROJECT    Do you have any questions or comments about what we talked about today?   Now we are going to discuss the Personal Project that you are going to complete during this week before our next session.   1. Mood thermometer (see below).  This thermometer lets us evaluate the intensity of depressive symptoms or mood at the end of each day.  Model how to complete the mood thermometer and practice completing it together based on his/her mood yesterday.   . This exercise is called the “Mood Thermometer” and you are going to complete is every week. We want to see how you feel each day andyou’re your mood changes throughout therapy.  . To complete it, at the end of each day, mark how you felt or how your mood was in general for that day.  For example, if it was “the worst” then you should circle number 1, if is was “regular” then you would circle number 5 and if is was “the best” then you would circle number 9. Let’s do one to practice using your mood yesterday. Use the Mood thermometer in your manual.  . Bring it completed to next week’s session so we can discuss it.   Mood Thermometer  HOW YOUR THOUGHTS AFFECT YOUR MOOD (SESSION 2)  REVIEW – Review or summarize briefly the following concepts discussed in Session 1 (promote adolescent participation in this review):  ..  Depression ..  Cognitive Behavioral therapy for depression ..  Mood Thermometer: How did you feel completing it each day? Any surprises? ..  Reinforce the important of completing the Mood Thermometer as a way to see how mood fluctuates.   1. WHAT ARE THOUGHTS?                                                                                                        Ask this open question to facilitate a discussion about thoughts. Include the definition presented below:  . Thoughts are ideas (phrases or sentences) that we tell ourselves. We are constantly talking to ourselves internally, but often we’re not always aware of it.  It is helpful to think about thoughts as "objects" (ideas) that have a real effect on our bodies and minds.  2. YOUR THOUGHTS AFFECT YOUR MOOD (HOW YOU FEEL):  . Different types of thoughts produce different effects on your mood. Some thoughts increase symptoms of depression, while others help you feel better.   3. HOW DO PEOPLE WITH DEPRESSION THINK?                                                                       Ask this open question promoting a brainstorm on the typical thoughts people with depression might have. Some of the thoughts generated during this brainstorm can be used later on and classified according to the following material.   Of these thoughts you mentioned, which ones have you had?   People with depression tend to have different types of negative thoughts (inflexible, judgmental, destructive and unnecessary). You can use the contrast between the different types of thoughts.    NEGATIVE   o Thoughts are all thoughts that make you feel bad, for example: “I am always going to feel depressed” or “I am useless.”  POSITIVE   o Thoughts make you feel better, for example: “I can do things to feel better.” “I am getting better each day.” INFLEXIBLE  o Inflexible thoughts are thoughts that are rigid, thoughts that don’t change. For example, a depressed adolescent might think: “I’m the only one they ask to do things at our house.”  “I can’t do anything right.” o A flexible thought that could help avoid depressed feelings could be: “My parents almost always ask me to do things, but sometimes they ask my sister.” “There are lots of times when I do things right.”  JUDGMENTAL  o Judgmental thoughts are negative thoughts about ourselves. For example, a depressed adolescent might think: “I’m ugly” o “I’m a loser”.   o A flexible thought could be: “I might not be the most attractive person in the World, but I’m not the ugliest.”  “I have qualities that make me a nice person" or “I can't please everybody."  DESTRUCTIVE:   o Destructive thoughts harm us.  For example, “I am worthless.” “Nothing I do comes out right.” o “I’ve made so many mistakes there’s no way to solve my problems” o Constructive thoughts help you feel better. For example, “I can learn to control my life so I can do what I really want.”   UNNECESSARY:   o Unnecessary thoughts don’t change anything and they make us feel bad.  For example, “A hurricane is going to hit us” or “something bad is going to happen to my parents” or “they’re not going to give me permission to go”. o Necessary thoughts remind you of the things you have to do, such as: “I have to do my homework to improve my grades” or “Mom asked me to do the dishes before going to the party.”  4. HOW DO PEOPLE WHO AREN’T DEPRESSED THINK?  Illustrate the differences between thoughts that depressed people have versus thoughts that people who aren’t depressed have.   THEY CAN SEE THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THINGS  o Depressed: “My family is a disaster.”  “I’m stupid." o Flexible: “My family has their problems, but they also have good things.”  “If I can create good study habits I can improve my grades.”     DON’T DEFINE THEMSELVES BY THEIR MISTAKES, THEY LEARN FROM THEM  o Depressed: “The coach pulled me out of the game, I’m useless”  “I got an F, I am a loser.” o Flexible: “Today I had a bad day, I didn’t play too well. I’ll have to practice a bit more.”  “Math isn’t my strongest subject, but I can work hard on extra credit assignments to improve my grade.”   THEY HAVE HOPE FOR CHANGE   o Depressed: “Nothing has ever helped.”  “Nothing will ever change.” o Flexible: “None of the things I have tried up to now have helped, but this is new and it could be a good time to start to feel better.”  “I could start changing some things that are under my control.”  “I’m going to keep trying until I find a solution.”  5. LEARNING TO IDENTIFY DIFFERENT TYPES OF HARMFUL OR COUNTERPRODUCTIVE THOUGHTS:         Discuss the List of Thinking Errors:  . We are going to discuss different types of negative thoughts, or ways of looking at things that happen to us, that are harmful because they make us feel bad because they are not based on facts or they distort reality.  . For a description of each type of thinking error, look at the worksheet called Thinking Errors in your manual.    Read and discuss each type of thought.  Make sure the adolescent understands each thought category. One way to make sure is asking him/her to provide an example of each thought after discussing each thinking style.                TYPES OF THINKING ERRORS    1. Mood Thermometer.    2. Keep a record of your thoughts. Complete the List of Positive and Negative Thoughts that are in your manual.  At the end of each day read the list and mark each thought you had. Add up the total number of positive and negative thoughts. See if there’s a relationship between the number of each type of thought (positive or negative) and your mood.   3. Try to identify each one of the following thoughts according to the Thinking Errors category that we discussed in session today. Try to change them to more positive and flexible thoughts.    All or nothing thinking: This is when you look at things as if they were completely good or completely bad. For example, if you make a mistake doing something, you think all your work was useless.  You might think, "I’m not even going to try out for the team because I’ll never get picked.” Or “I can’t do anything right.”  Mental Filter: This is when you take a single negative event and you focus on it in such a way that you see everything as negative and think everything is going wrong. It also refers to making or seeing things as bigger than they really are. For example, "a patient came into treatment one day and told us that she had seen a dead bird on the sidewalk and it made her feel really bad. She had walked through a beautiful garden, full of trees and flowers and all she saw was the dead bird.” Another example, “An art student received a constructive criticism on her artwork from her teacher. He only suggested that she change the color on one of the edges of the canvas. Because of this comment, the student thought she wasn’t a good artist.   Discounting the positive: This is when you don’t notice positive things that happen you only see the negative things. Or you when positive things happen they seem less important to you than they really are.  For example, you might believe that nobody likes you to the extent that if someone is nice to you, you think that something must be wrong with that person.  Or if someone tells you how good you look, you think he or she says it just so you won't feel bad.  Jumping to the wrong conclusions: This is when you come to conclusions too quickly and you see the negative side of things.  There are two types:            Mind reading:  This is when you assume what someone is thinking without really knowing.     For example, you see that someone is angry and you think the person doesn't like you or that the person is angry with you.  It might well be that the person is having his/her own difficulties.   Other examples: "Dad thinks I'm stupid" or “the coach won’t let me play anymore because I didn’t score in the game, he thinks I am a bad player.”     Fortune-telling: This is when you feel and predict that only disasters and tragedies will happen to you in the future.  For example, "I'm going to flunk out of school" or "I won't have any friends at my new school" or "No one’s going to want to dance with me at the party" or "I'm not going to the audition because I'll never be picked."  Taking your feelings too seriously: This is when you think that your feelings are the only version of reality.  For example, you think, "I feel so sad that it proves what a disaster I am" or "I’m so lonely that my life has no meaning." “I am always bored so other people probably seem me as a boring person.”  Shoulds/Perfecctionism: This is when you try to motivate yourself with shoulds; that is, with what you believe people should or have to do or say.  Even if there are things you need to do, it’s important to be careful not to have unrealistic, excessive or inflexible expectations for yourself. For example, you might think, "I should get all As in school" or "My Mom should pay attention to me all the time" or “my boyfriend/girlfriend should always go out with me whenever I want.”   When you tell yourself you should, you feel guilty. It’s better to do things the best you can and because you want to, not because you feel guilty. When you think shoulds about other people, you get angry and frustrated if they don’t do things the way you expect them to.   Labeling yourself or others: Only because you make one mistake, you start to think you're a loser.  For example, you might say, "I yelled at Mom, I’m a bad daughter" or "I’m stupid because I have bad grades" or "I'm ugly."  You might also label others: "The teacher is stupid because she scolded me." “She’s a traitor because now she hangs out with other friends besides me.”   Blaming yourself: This is when you blame yourself for the negative things that happen around you and over which you have no control.  For example, if something bad happens to one of your family members or friends, you feel as if it was your fault because you couldn’t prevent it. Or if your parents get divorced, you feel it was your fault because they were always arguing in front of you.               LIST OF NEGATIVE THOUGHTS  Mark (X) next to the negative thoughts you had each day.                           DATE  Saturday  Sunday  Monday  Tuesday  Wednesday  Thursday  Friday  I’m confused.                There is no love in the world.                I’m wasting my life.                I’m afraid.                I’ll end up alone.                No one considers friendship important.                I have no patience.                Nothing’s worth it.                It’s tough to go on.                I’m stupid.                Anyone who thinks I’m nice doesn’t really know me.                Life has no meaning.                I’m ugly.                I can’t express my feelings.                I’ll never find what I really want.                I’m not capable of loving.                I’m worthless.                My hopes have vanished.                I’m useless.                I won’t be able to solve my problems.                Everything I do turns out wrong.                I’ll never be able to change.                Everything gets ruined.                I have no enthusiasm for anything.                I wish I were never born.                I won’t be able to sleep.                I’m inferior to others.                Everything’s my fault.                Why does everything bad happen to me?

Mood Thermometer  . Types of thoughts people who are depressed have.  . List of Positive and Negative Thoughts What are some of the thoughts you had this past week?   1. INCREASING THOUGHTS THAT IMPROVE YOUR MOOD   STOP EVERYTHING YOUR ARE DOING  When we feel nervous we can take a break and mentally give ourselves a time out.  Let your mind relax and take a deep breath. Pay attention to your body’s natural ability to relax and feel at peace. Feeling at peace can give you energy. You lead the adolescent in a relaxation exercise after discussing this point (Appendix C). Pick the exercise you feel most comfortable leading. You can use sounds or music to help relaxation.   INCREASE THE NUMBER OF POSITIVE THOUGHTS IN YOUR MIND   Make a list of good thoughts you have about yourself and about life in general. Provide the adolescent with a blank sheet of paper to do this exercise, and discuss it afterwards.   CONGRATULATE YOURSELF MENTALLY  Other people do not notice most of the things we do.  Therefore, it is important for us to acknowledge them and give ourselves credit for doing them.                                   You can ask the adolescent to identify a reason to congratulate him/herself mentally.   PROJECTION INTO THE FUTURE   Imagine yourself in the future, at a time when things will be better. Ask the adolescent to imagine his/her future in 1, 5 and 10 years. Encourage him/her to imagine it as detailed as possible [i.e., places, people, activities, etc.].  See Appendix D  for an example. The exercise can be oral or written.       2. DECREASING THOUGHTS THAT MAKE US FEEL BAD  INTERRUPT YOUR THOUGHTS   When a thought is ruining your mood, we can identify it and try to interrupt it. First, identify the thought.  Next, tell yourself: “This thought is ruining my mood, so I am going to change it or substitute it for a positive one.”  TIME TO WORRY  Set aside "time to worry" each day so that you can concentrate completely on necessary thoughts and leave the rest of the day free of worries.  The "time to worry" can be 10 to 30 minutes each day.       LAUGH AT YOUR PROBLEMS BY EXAGGERATING THEM  If you have a good sense of humor, try to laugh at your worries.  If you feel you don’t have a good sense of humor, try to do it any way you can.  Sometimes this can take away the pain of certain hardships. For example, you can ask the adolescent what’s the most embarrassing that has ever happened to him/her.                                   CONSIDER THE WORST THAT COULD HAPPEN    . Often some of the fears we have about what could happen make us feel depressed and they paralyze us.  . To help you stop making negative predictions and prepare yourself for what could happen, it’s useful to ask yourself – What could happen if ____? Or what would really be the worst thing that could happen if_____? . Remember that the worst thing that could happen is only one of many possibilities and just because it’s the worst doesn’t mean that is the most probable.  . It’s good to ask yourself whether you’re exaggerating what could happen. Maybe none of the things you fear will happen, but if you consider the different possibilities you’ll be better prepared.   o An example, you have failing grades in several classes. Your parents are pressuring you and you’re afraid of flunking your grade. You could think – what is the worst that could happen if I fail? One possibility is that you’ll have to take tutoring or repeat a class during the summer and your parents will be upset. You would feel bad and possibly your parents would be upset for some time, but you could handle it, and resides, you could review the material you didn’t learn so well in order to get better grades next year.    3. Being your own trainer  Just as we can help someone to do something difficult by coaching them or giving them instructions, we can help ourselves by coaching ourselves.  This is what we mean by learning to feel better.   Practice time  Now let us think of some examples of how to use these ideas.  Think about   how to use the examples with the thoughts you have had this week.        Your can discuss what strategies, of the ones discussed in this session, he/she could use in particular situations.                  1. Mood Thermometer  2. List of  Positive and Negative Thoughts  3.

Mood Thermometer . List of Positive and Negative Thoughts - What are some of the thoughts you had last week? . What strategies did you use to increase positive thoughts and decrease negative ones?  1. DEBATING/DISPUTING YOUR NEGATIVE THOUGHTS – THE A-B-C-D METHOD.  When you feel depressed, ask yourself what you are thinking.  Then try to talk back to the thought that is bothering or hurting you.    A is the Activating event; what happened B is the Belief or the thought that you are having; that is, what you tell yourself about what is happening  C is the Consequence of your thought; that is, the feeling you have as a result of your thought D is the way in which you Dispute or talk back to your thought (this means that you challenge negative thoughts and generate alternate positive thoughts)   In these examples, you can use the ABCD method in the following way (it’s better to use examples from the adolescent’s experiences)):  A My Dad didn’t come for me this weekend (this is a fact).   B Some of the thoughts you might have about this fact are: “My dad doesn’t care about me”, o “My Dad doesn’t want to spend time with me”  C The consequence of thinking these thoughts is feeling mad, sad and disappointed.    D I can talk to these thoughts in the following way: "My Dad cancelled because of problems he has with my Mom”, “My Dad has always shown me in other ways that even loves me even if he can’t spend a lot of time with me.”   Example:  A My best friend doesn’t return my call.  B Some thoughts you might have about this fact are: “She doesn’t want to talk to me”, or “she doesn’t want to be my friend anymore”, “you can’t trust anyone.” C The consequence of these thoughts is feeling mad, sad and hopeless. Another consequence might be that when you do manage to talk to her, you treat her badly (you’re sarcastic or you give her the silent treatment).  D I can talk to these thoughts in the following manner:” She might be busy”, “Maybe she didn’t get the message.” “I’ll wait to talk to her to find out what happened.”  Example:  A I have an F in two classes and it’s already mid-semester.  B I’m stupid, I can’t do anything right. I’m going to have to repeat the 10th grade. I’m never going to be able to study or work at what I want. C I felt sad, frustrated and mad.   D I still have the chance to find opportunities to pull up my grades, such as doing extra credit work or finding a tutor. I might have to repeat the class during the summer, but it doesn’t mean I won’t graduate, or be able to do what I want. I’m smart and there are some classes that are harder for me than others.   Example:  A My boyfriend dumped me.  B I’m ugly, I did something wrong, I should have done everything he wanted me to. No other guy will ever like me.  C I felt awful and I cried a lot. I locked myself in my room. D It’s better that I be with someone who loves and appreciates me. The relationship with him didn’t work, but it’s not necessarily something I did or didn’t do. I can be attractive to other guys.   2. EXCERCISES WITH THE ABCD METHOD  . When you feel depressed ask yourself what you’re thinking. Then try to talk back to the thought that’s bothering you.   Using the worksheet titled Working with the ABCD Method in the participant’s manual, use a situation that the adolescent has brought up in therapy to practice the ABCD method.   3. SOME THOUGHTS THAT CAN CONTRIBUTE TO FEELING DEPRESSED   The following thoughts are thoughts that people with depression commonly have and can make them feel worse.  Generate a discussion in which you and the adolescent change or modify the following thoughts to more positive and flexible ones.  Following each negative thought are examples of alternate thoughts. One way of doing this exercise is reading each one out loud and modeling for the adolescent how to change it to a more positive, flexible one. Afterwards you can ask the adolescent to do the same with the next thought on the list.     . “Everyone should love/like me.” “Not everyone has to like me.” “I have people who love me very much.”  . “I should do everything right all of the time” “I want to do things the best way possible.  “I’m going to do the best I can.” “I do lots of things right.”  . “I am a bad person.” “I make mistakes just like everybody else, and that doesn’t mean I’m bad.” “I can learn from my mistakes”   “Everybody makes mistakes.”  . “I will feel awful if things don’t happen the way I want them to.” “Things aren’t always going to turn out the way I’d like.”   . “I should worry about the bad things that can happen.” “There’s no point in worrying about things I have no control over” “I don’t know what might happen in the future.”  . “Nobody loves me.” “I might feel rejected right now but it doesn’t mean I don’t have people who love me.”   . “I’ll never be able to be happy.” “I feel unhappy right now, but things can get better.”  . “I should feel bad when when people I care about are having a hard time.” “It’s important to support the people I love when they’re having a hard time, but feeling bad won’t help solve their problems.”  . “I need everyone's approval to feel good about myself.” “I can feel good even though other people don’t agree with the things I do.”  . “I have to be popular and accepted by my friends to feel like I am worth something.”        “I can’t expect everyone to like me the important thing is to have good friends.”  . “My family suffers because of me.” “There are problems in my family that I can’t control.” “Blaming myself isn’t going to solve our problems.”   . “It’s my responsibility to solve the people I love’s problems.” “It’s not my responsibility to solve other people’s problems, but I can support them.” “I help with what I can.”    4.

Mood Thermometer  . List of Positive and Negative Thoughts  . The A-B-C-D Method . In this treatment we work with thoughts, activities and relationships to improve our mood or how we feel. In the module we’ll be starting today we will be working with activities and how they affect how we feel.   2. THE ACTIVITIES THAT WE DO AFFECT OUR MOOD: THROUGH OUR ACTIVIES WE CAN TELL HOW WE FEEL.  The fewer pleasant activities people do, the more depressed they feel.   Do you stop doing things because you feel depressed? or Do you feel depressed because you stop doing things?  The most probable answer is BOTH:  The fewer things you do, the more depressed you feel.  The more depressed you feel, the fewer things you do.  This is called a "VICIOUS CYCLE."          Cycle Diagram. To break the vicious cycle you can increase those activities that make you feel better. . These activities can be called "pleasant", "encouraging", "inspiring", etc.  We call them "pleasant."  2. PLEASANT ACTIVITIES DO NOT HAVE TO BE SPECIAL ACTIVITIES (ALTHOUGH THEY CAN BE).    . By pleasant activities we are referring mostly to everyday activities (i.e. listen to music, watch TV, read a book, talk on the phone, surf the Internet).    3. Sometimes it is hard to think about what we consider pleasant, especially if we haven't done it in a long time.  When we are depressed, it is even harder to remember pleasant things.  To help you we use a List of Pleasant Activities. What activities do you enjoy? When you feel depressed, are there things you stop doing?  4. For the next week, you will keep a daily record of the number of pleasant activities you do.  Use the List of Pleasant Activities by putting a mark next to each pleasant activity you do every day. Personalize your list. If any of the activities do not apply to you, leave it blank or put a line through it. You probably have never done this before in your life. Lots of people find this exercise interesting and useful. This week you don’t have to do anything other than what you usually do. Just identify the pleasant activities that you do each day of this week. By doing this, you’ll learn something about how your daily activities affect how you feel.   5. SOMETIMES OBSTACLES GET IN THE WAY OF OUR DOING CERTAIN PLEASANT ACTIVITIES.   What obstacles or things prevent you from doing pleasant activities? Ask for specific examples of obstacles to doing pleasant activities.   Some obstacles to working with pleasant activities are:  . YOUR THOUGHTS:    . What kind of thoughts help you enjoy an activity? . What thoughts make it hard for you to enjoy an activity? . Have you ever enjoyed an activity that you thought you wouldn’t?  .

Mood Thermometer  . List of Pleasant Activities How did you feel keeping track of your activities? How many did you do each day?  More information on pleasant activities:  1. How can pleasant activities help you feel better?  You can make reference to the diagram that represents the interaction between our thoughts, actions and feelings (Appendix A).  . It is not enough to say to yourself, "Feel better!" It is often easier to change the things you do. If you change the things you do, you can also change the way you feel.  2. Remember that:  . Pleasant activities do not necessarily have to be special activities, although they can be special. Pleasant activities are often ordinary activities that we enjoy. o Some examples are watching the sun set, reading a book, talking to a friend, play sports, going to a park, smelling a flower, drawing or painting, listening to music. . Pleasant activities can be different for different people.  For example, some people find reading a book while alone is a very pleasant activity. Other people can find being in a noisy and crowded shopping center fun.  3. It is important to have an adequate number of pleasant activities in order to feel good.  . We feel our best when our activities are well-balanced between things we” have to do" and things we "want to do."  Since we have more control over the things we want to do, it is important to keep these activities in mind and do them. . What are some of the things you have to do? What things do you do because you enjoy them? Do you have a good balance?  4. The problem with things that put demands on your time and the need for doing pleasant activities.    . Often it is hard to create a balance between things we have to do and things we want to do. One solution to deal with this problem is planning our time. Explore whether the adolescents keeps an agenda or date book of this weekly activities. Afterwards present and discuss the advantages of using a Weekly Activities Schedule.  Practice using the worksheet titled Weekly Activities Schedule by asking him/her to write down the activities he/she does on a daily basis and the time he/she does them. Encourage him/her to use it during the week.   . Planning and programming your activities is a way to gain more control over your life.   5. Doing pleasant activities without spending a lot of money.        Exercise:  Make a list of pleasant activities that the adolescent can do that don’t cost a lot.  6. Anticipating problems.  Exercise: From the List of Pleasant Activities choose one that you would like to do.  Let’s think of things that might prevent you from doing that activity so that you can prepare for possible problems and plan for solutions so that they don’t interfere with your activity.                                       Do this exercise you should consider the following questions:  . How can you organize and plan your time? . How can you use your thoughts to help you plan and enjoy this activity? . What could be a potential obstacle to doing this activity? . How can we manage this/these obstacle(s)?                   1.  Mood Thermometer  2.

Mood Thermometer  . List of Pleasant Activities  . Weekly Activities Schedule  . Personal contract and Prediction of Pleasant Activities What we hope you will learn from this experiment is: . You don't need to wait until you "feel like doing something" to do it. You can choose to do something and really do it. . You can enjoy certain activities even if you thought they wouldn't be fun. . You can influence your mood with your activities. The more you practice doing this, the more control you will have over your mood.   Creating your own plan for overcoming depression - One way is by establishing goals.  1. WHAT ARE GOALS? How can reaching goals help you feel better? Ask these questions to promote a discussion.   2. THERE ARE SEVERAL TYPES OF GOALS:  SHORT TERM GOALS  . Things you’d like to do soon (say in the next 6 months)   LONG TERM GOALS  . Things you’d like to do at some point in your life   LIFETIME GOALS  . Your life philosophy. What do you care most about in life?  3. IDENTIFYING GOALS – WHAT ARE YOUR GOALS?  Ask the adolescent to write down his short term, long term and lifetime goals on the worksheet Personal Goals. Use one of the goals he/she wrote to discuss how to establish goals using the following guides.    4. SETTING CLEAR, CONCRETE GOALS:  . Set clear, concrete goals so that you can be sure of when you’ve reached them.   UNCLEAR GOALS (global - general)  CLEAR GOALS  (specific - concrete)  Be less bored   Go to the mall once a week  Be a good friend  Spend three hours a week doing pleasant things with your friends  Be a good musician  Spend x hours a week practicing an instrument  Get better grades  Study for two hours every afternoon  Lose weight  Walk 30 minutes a day and follow a healthy diet (portions, healthy foods, 10% less calories, or most appropriate)   . Which one of your goals can be clearer and more concrete?  5. BREAK DOWN YOUR BIG GOALS INTO SMALLER PARTS:  . Make sure that each part can be achieved without too much effort. If your goal is to be a good baseball player, then you could start by finding out were the nearest baseball park is and what times you can practice.  . Which one of your goals could you divide into smaller parts?  6. SETTING REALISTIC GOALS:  . It is often difficult to determine beforehand what’s realistic and what’s not.  What’s not realistic today can be realistic in the future.  However, if you find you can't meet most of your goals now, then they are probably not realistic for you at this time. . Do you think your goals are realistic?                                             Evaluate with the adolescent whether he/she can reach his/her goal taking into consideration his/her: abilities, resources, motivation, etc.  7. WHAT ARE SOME OF THE OBSTACLES THAT PREVENT YOU FROM ACHIEVING YOUR GOALS?                                                                                After discussing the exercise, ask the adolescent to identify possible obstacles to achieving his/her goals.   8. TO MAKE CHANGES IN OUR LIVES, SOMETIMES WE NEED TO MAKE CHANGES IN OUR GOALS:  . Things that are realistic might become unrealistic.  For example: An adolescent plays volleyball and she’d like to play in a major league. She hurts her knee badly during a game, and she can’t keep playing that sport. However, maybe she can become a volleyball coach or assistant coach. . Things that were unrealistic might become realistic.  For example: An adolescent wanted to be able to drive his mother’s car. His mother told him that he still wasn’t old enough to do so.  He felt like he would never get to drive, he saw it as so far away. Finally he turned 16 and his mom let him drive under her supervision.      Ask the adolescent if he/she can come up with another example.   If a change occurs in your life that requires a change in goals, then maybe you’ll have to: o Enjoy activities in new ways  o Develop new interests, abilities and activities.                        9. TO HELP OVERCOME DEPRESSION:  . Establish realistic goals. . Recognize the positive things you do to reach them.  . Congratulate and reward yourself mentally and in real life.                            1. Mood Thermometer  2. Weekly Acitivies Schedule  3. Time management: Make a list of the goals you’d like to complete this week. Put them in order of priority. Are you really sure that you want to do the last ones on your list?

Mood Thermometer  . Weekly Activities Schedule . List of personal goals    DEPRESSION AND THE HEALTHY MANAGEMENT OF REALITY  . Present the adolescent with several pictures (Appendix D) and ask what he/she sees? These pictures can be interpreted in different ways – all of them correct. Promote a discussion about the pictures and how different perceptions can be had of each one. The purpose is to illustrate the difference between the objective and the subjective world, and how our perceptions about the same thing or event can be different from that of other people.   1. WE LIVE IN TWO WORLDS:  1) The objective world (the world outside, everything outside of us) For example, the places, people and events around us that we can’t change (where we live, the school we go to, who are parents are).  2) The subjective (internal) world (our internal world, what’s inside our minds) for example, our thoughts, beliefs, wishes, feelings and dreams (how we perceive what we do and what happens to us).   2. THESE TWO WORLDS ARE OUR REALITY.  The key to feeling emotionally healthy is:  To learn how to manage these two parts of our reality.  . The objective world, generally speaking, we can’t change, but we can learn ways to manage it in a way that it doesn’t’ affect how we feel so much.  o For example, you can’t change the fact that your parents are getting a divorce, but you can change the way you react to it. You can isolate yourself, be mad at them, or think it’s your fault. You can also find a friend to talk to, think that your parents are adults and they must know why they made that decision, and try to do pleasant activities that can help make you feel better. You can see the possible positive side to this, which could be that they are happier and there is more peace at home.   . On the other hand, we can have more control over our subjective world. When people are depressed, the often perceive their subjective world as the only reality.    o For example, remember when we talked about thinking errors. If you don’t change your negative thoughts, you might think they are the only reality and that will continue to make you feel depressed.     3. NO ONE COMPLETELY CONTROLS THESE TWO WORLDS. HOWEVER, YOU CAN LEARN TO HAVE MORE CONTROL OVER YOUR SUBJECTIVE WORLD AND IDENTIFY WAYS TO MANAGE THE OBJECTIVE WORLD.   . When people are depressed they feel that have no control, that there’s nothing they can do to feel better. However, things can always change and improve.                                        4. THERE ARE WAYS TO FEEL YOU HAVE MORE CONTROL AND FEEL LESS DEPRESSED.    ALTERNATIVES  . Sometimes we find ourselves in situations in which it’s hard to make decisions because we don’t see alternatives or we only see one. It can also happen that we feel we don’t have any alternatives when things don’t happen the way we want them to. On these occasions it helps to consider all the alternatives and not to focus on that fact that you don’t have what you really wanted.   . The more alternatives you have, the more freedom you’ll have.   . Have you ever found yourself in situations such as these? If the adolescent doesn’t provide an example, you can present him/her with one of the following situations, asking them to provide alternatives to them:   o A guy you don’t have romantic feelings for invites you to a party, but you enjoy his company as a friend. You want to ask a guy you really like or hope that he asks you.  o Your friends invite you to go out, but your mom asked you to help your grandfather cut the grass because he hasn’t felt well lately and can’t do it alone.    THINKING THAT THE WORLD IS MADE UP OF CHUNKS OF TIME  . It’s common when people feel depressed for them to think they’re always going to feel that way. They can also think that their depression won’t go away unless something in the objective world changes. If you see the world as little chunks of time that you decide what to do with, you can feel more in control and take action to overcome your depression.     Be careful of telling yourself:   o “I can’t enjoy life until _______________”.  For example, if you tell yourself:   o “I can’t enjoy life until my depression goes away”, consider thinking – “I can feel better every day if I do the things I have been learning.” o "I won’t be happy until I have a boyfriend/girlfriend” – consider thinking – “I can enjoy spending time with my friends and meeting new people.”   Have you ever had these kinds of thoughts? “I can’t enjoy life until _______________.”  What can you do to change that type of thought to one such as:  “To enjoy my life I am going to _______________________.”  5. MAKING YOUR TWO WORLDS HEALTHIER FOR YOU.  . Making your outside world healthier.  . What things in your outside world are contributing to your depression? What can you do about them now?  o Let’s talk about your alternatives.  Mention two alternatives (concrete actions) that you have to manage the outside world.   o Let’s talk about your time. How do you use your time to reach those alternatives? . Making your inside or internal world healthier.  .  What things in your internal world are contributing to your depression? You can ask the adolescent whether there are still negative thoughts that he/she has often, and work with these thought in alternatives and time (below).   What can you do about them now?  o Let’s talk about your alternatives.  Mention two alternatives (concrete actions) that you have to manage your internal world.   o Let’s talk about your time. Do you spend a lot of time thinking you want to change the past or anticipating the future?   6. REVIEW OF THE ACTIVITIES MODULE: What did you learn?  . Pleasant activities and the way you manage your internal and outside worlds make help make your time more satisfactory. When your time becomes more satisfactory, your life will also and you will feel better. Integrate pleasant activities into your life plan. If pleasant activities help you overcome your depression, they can also help you feel healthier emotionally.   . The better you feel, the more you can help yourself and others.      1. Mood Thermometer  2. Weekly Activities Schedule   HOW YOUR RELATIONSHIPS AFFECT YOUR MOOD  (SESSION 9)  REVIEW – Review or summarize briefly the following concepts discussed in Session 8 (promote adolescent participation in this review):  . Mood Thermometer  . Weekly Activities Schedule . Review how we understand depression according to CBT (Appendix A ) . In this treatment we work with thoughts, activities and relationships (family, friends, others) to improve your mood. In this module (the last 4 sessions) we will be working with your relationships and how they affect how you feel.  1. LET’S WORK WITH HOW YOUR CONTACT WITH OTHER PEOPLE AFFECTS YOUR MOOD.    Severe depression is associated with:  . Having less contact with others . Feeling uncomfortable, shy or mad at others . Being less assertive (not saying what you like/dislike or not knowing how to express your feelings and preferences) . Being more prone to feeling rejected, ignored, or criticized   2. DOES DEPRESSION CAUSE PEOPLE TO BE LESS SOCIABLE? OR DOES BEING LESS SOCIABLE MAKE PEOPLE TO GET DEPRESSED?  The answer is probably that depression and lack of contact with other people influence one another.  o For example, a change of school can mean leaving a lot of friends behind. This can make you feel sad. If when you feel sad you don’t make an effort at making new friends, your sadness can become depression. Feeling depressed may make you feel less sociable, which will make you even more depressed because you’re spending a lot of time sad and lonely.   3. THE IMPORTANCE OF SOCIAL SUPPORT  . The support we receive from being in contact with other people is important for our health.  The contacts we have with our family and friends create a kind of protective social network or "social support network". . The system or "social support network" refers to people who are close to us and with whom you share important information or important moments of your life.  These people can be family, friends, neighbors, classmates and acquaintances. In general, the stronger the social support we receive, the more we are able to confront difficult situations.   4. WHAT IS YOUR SOCIAL SUPPORT NETWORK LIKE?  Who are your friends?            How often do you  see them?  What do you do? Who do you trust?  Exercise: Recreate your social support network using the diagram on the My Social Support Network worksheet.  The adolescent should his/her name in the center circle and in each shape write the name of someone in their network. In discussing this exercise, evaluate the quality and quantity of his/her network and whether it should be expanded or strengthened.   5. TWO IMPORTANT PRINCIPLES TO KEEP IN MIND IN THE FUTURE.  . If your social support network is too small, make it larger.  Your network is too small if there is no one you trust to talk about your personal matters, if you have no one to go to if you need help, or if you have no friends or acquaintances to do things with.  . If your network is adequate and of a good size, appreciate it and try to keep it strong.  In other words, don't let disagreements cause separations between you and the people in your network.  Frequent communication helps maintain friendships. . The four sessions this month will focus on how to enlarge and maintain your  social support network.  6. KEEPING YOUR SOCIAL SUPPORT NETWORK HEALTHY   How can we maintain a healthy social support network? Ask this open question to promote a discussion. Some examples can be: spending time with people, showing people how you feel about them, being assertive, helping your friends and family, working with negative thoughts that can be harmful to relationships  . Contact with others is very important, be it by phone or in person (talk, listen, go out, do activities together).  . Some thoughts that can block this. For example:  o  “They haven’t called me; it looks like they don’t care about me.” o “I am not going to be the one to make the first move.”  o “They don’t like me.” o “No one in my family understands me.” o “My mom never listens.” o “I can never forgive him/her.”  7. MEETING PEOPLE  . Ask the following open questions, promoting a discussion.  How do you make friends? What have your friends done to get closer to you? What does a friendly or sociable person do? o The easiest way to meet other people is by doing an activity you like in the company of others.   . When you enjoy something, it’s more likely that you’ll be in a good mood and that way it’ll be easier to be sociable and friendly.   . Even if you don’t find anyone in particular that you want to get to know better, you’ll be doing something you enjoy and you won’t feel it was a waste of your time.   . Since the main focus will be on the activity and not on meeting other people, it’s more likely that you’ll feel less pressure than you’d feel if the only purpose was meeting new people. If there were people you want to get to know better, it’s more probable that they’ll have things in common with you.   Exercise:  How and where can you meet people? Promote a discussion or list places and ways you can meet new people and make friends.   8. HOW TO ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS: BEING ASSERTIVE.   . What’s the difference between being passive, assertive and aggressive? . There are three ways we can act and communicate with others:  o Being passive means not expressing your feelings to others because you think they’ll be annoyed, feel bad or because they are superior to you.  You might feel you have to “swallow” your feelings or you’ll be rejected.  o Being aggressive jeans treating others with hostility, anger and being insensitive to other people’s needs and feelings because you feel yours are more important.   o Being assertive means being able to say positive and negative things without feeling bad. You don’t always have to say what you think, but it’s important to feel that you have that option. You can say things in a nice way that can help resolve situations and maintain the relationship healthy.        1. Mood Thermometer  2.

WHEN TRYING TO LEARN HOW TO FEEL BETTER, THERE ARE THREE AREAS YOU SHOULD FOCUS ON: Present the diagram about understanding depression (Appendix A).    . In this session we are going to explore how your thoughts, actions and feelings influence your relationships and how your relationships affect these three areas. Before talking about how these three areas are affected by your relationships, it’s important to evaluate first how they are when you are alone.   2. BEING ALONE.  When you’re alone, what are your ______________like?  . thoughts  . actions or behavior  . feelings  3. BEING WITH OTHERS   YOUR THOUGHTS  What thoughts do you have when you are with other people?  o Thoughts that prevent you from making friends.                                                Ask for examples. . Some examples: “Will they like me? I don’t like him/her, What if they reject or ignore me? I don’t know what to say.” o Thoughts that help you feel comfortable with other people.                      Ask for examples. o One way to feel better is to shift the focus of attention from you to the other person and think about how he/she feels. Think about how you feel when you’re going to meet new people. Other people probably feel the same way.                                       Some examples: “I’ve never talked to him/her so I don’t know what he/she is like. I’ve got nothing to lose by trying. Maybe he/she will enjoy talking to me.”  YOUR EXPECTATIONS  . What can you expect from other people? . What can others expect from you?  You can explain this concept using parent-child relationships and/or friendships. You can ask the adolescent to share experiences that will help in the discussion.  o If your expectations are too high, you’ll be disappointed and maybe you’ll become frustrated.  o If your expectations are too low, you won’t expect anything from the relationship and you might lose the chance to develop good relationships. Also, if you expect little from people, you’re not giving them the chance to show you what they can really offer.   YOUR ACTIONS/BEHAVIOR   . How do you approach others? . What impression do you think you give off to others?  Present the following information and discuss by relating to the adolescent’s experience.   o Your face: Do you smile often? Do you make eye contact?  o Your body: Do you look tired or worn out?  o Your appearance: Is it appropriate for the time and place?  o Your speech: Is it too slow or too soft to hear you? Do you speak with anger or irritation? Do you raise your voice? o Your conversation: Do you show interest in what other people say, or do you ignore or criticize them? o Your attitude: Do you complain a lot? Are you in a bad mood? Do you offend others with your attitude?  YOUR FEELINGS  . How do your feelings affect your relationships? . Different emotions can influence the way you relate to others. There are times when we experience negative emotions (i.e. anger, sadness) that have nothing to do with the person we’re relating to. However, we let these feelings affect the relationship. This is way it’s important to be able to identify and manage our feelings in a healthy way.     . What feelings do you have when you’re with others?  . Identifying our feelings when we’re with other people can help us evaluate the quality of our relationship.  For this, it’s important to:  o Recognize how your feel and why you’re feeling that way o Communicate in an assertive or appropriate way what you feel  o The difference between being passive, assertive or aggressive:     Assertiveness  =  is being able to share positive and negative feelings clearly and comfortably (even if you think the other person won’t like what you’re saying).  Changing your point of view can help you to be more assertive instead of being passive.  For example, if you frequently think, "I don't want to make anyone feel bad," try to  think, "Saying what I think can help us communicate better and resolve the situation. At least I can let people know what I think."   4. REVIEW  . The purpose of examining your thoughts, actions and feelings is that you can identify how these three areas are influencing your relationship with others, and consider what you need to improve to have healthier relationships.  . You can change your mood if you work on improving your relationships. What areas do you think you can improve? . Summarize for the adolescent what you discussed in these sessions in relation to these three areas, his/her experience and relationships.    1. Mood Thermometer   HOW YOUR RELATIONSHIPS AFFECT YOUR MOOD  (SESSION 11)  REVIEW – Review or summarize briefly the following concepts discussed in Session 10 (promote adolescent participation in this review):  . Mood Thermometer  . Improving your relationships can help make you feel better.  1. Examine the adolescent’s thoughts, feelings and actions in relation to a person with    whom he/she has identified interpersonal difficulties.  Explore a problematic situation    that happened recently with that person. Use this relationship as material to work with    this session’s material.  2. When you’re with __________________________   . What do you think?  . How do you act? . How do you feel?  3. Learning to be assertive and practicing in your mind     Exercise: Ask the adolescent to think about a situation with a person with whom he/she has difficulty in being assertive. Provide the following instructions:  o Image the situation as if it were a photograph. o Imagine the action beginning as if it were a movie.  o Imagine telling that person something in an assertive way. o Imagine the response you get from that person.  This exercise is a useful way to rehearse being assertive before actually putting it into practice.   5. Communication skills.                                                                                                       Apply the following communication skills the situation discussed in the previous exercise.   Active listening  . When you are talking to someone, listen to what they are saying instead of thinking about you are going to say back or respond. If you’re thinking about what you’re going to answer, you might miss part of what the person is telling you. People often argue about what somebody said without knowing if that was what the person really wanted to say or express.   To improve your active listening and communication skills:   . Repeat what the other person said in your own words so you can be sure you understood him/her correctly. For example, “I understand that you’re saying____________.” . Ask the person directly what he/she meant to say. For example, What did you mean by __________?” . When we become mad with someone, instead of attacking them, it’s more effective to say what you think and/or feel in relation to what they are doing, or their actions.  Instead of saying – “You (are/always/never)…” It’s better to say – “I feel ________/I think________.” When we attack people they generally become defensive and aren’t going to listen to what we really want to tell them.   o Examples of verbalizations where you attack the other person: “You’re unfair.” “You never do what I want.” o Alternatives: “When you scold me before listening to what I have to say, I feel frustrated.” “When you say no, I feel like you don’t care about me and don’t want me to have any fun.” “I feel that you’re not listening.”  Exercise:  Step 1: State the fact or event and what bothered you about it. Step 2: State how you feel. Step 3: Say what you think.  “When you __________ I feel _______ because it makes me                   (yell at me)              (anxious)  think______________________.”                                                        (you don’t want to see me)                                      . Find the right moment to talk. The best times aren’t when the person is doing something, or there isn’t enough time to talk or if you’re in the middle of an argument. . Consider  your non-verbal language (gestures, facial expressions, posture, etc.) Non-verbal language is 80% of communication.  . Consider the tone of your voice.    . Follow the example of assertive people you know and ask them for suggestions (i.e., family, friends, teachers).  6. You can decide to change  Before being with other people                                                                                                  . Thinking differently: To change your feelings towards others, you can decide beforehand the kind of thoughts you want to have when you’re with them. .  . Acting differently: If you want to change your behavior when you’re with others, decide beforehand how you would like to act when you are around them.   After  being with other people   Learn from your experiences: think about the feelings you had while you were with them. How did you feel when you left? Can you define what made you feel good or bad?                1. Mood Thermometer 2. Practice being assertive during this week. Pick a simple situation in which you can practice.       HOW YOUR RELATIONSHIPS AFFECT YOUR MOOD  (SESSION 12)  REVIEW – Review or summarize briefly the following concepts discussed in Session 11 (promote adolescent participation in this review):  . Mood Thermometer  . Assertiveness exercise . Up until now, you have learned to think act and feel healthier. Sometimes in our lives things can happen that overwhelm us. Sometimes depression starts at these times. If you use the strategies you’ve learned here, it’s less likely that you become depressed again or that you remain depressed for a long time.  1.  Contact with others is important for you mood because they can___________:  . Share pleasant experiences with you . Help you reach your goals . Provide you with company and a sense of security . Provide you with valuable information about yourself, your strengths and areas to improve  2. It’s healthy to maintain relationships with others. However, relationships need constant attention. Nothing that is alive is static, it’s always changing. When relationships don’t work out, it doesn’t necessarily mean that something is wrong with you or with the other person. It’s helpful to consider the following questions:  . Do you both want the same thing from the relationship? . Do you have similar interests? . Are you capable of telling each other what you think and feel freely? . Do you have to make big changes or can you be yourself in the relationship? . Is this relationship good for you? And for the other person? . Is this relationship abusive?  Remember you always have the option to end a relationship that is not good for you.   3. Relationships can help improve your life.    What kind of friends can help you feel good? Improve your life? Your social environment can help you be a better person. You are a valuable person. You have good qualities and strengths. People can help you feel like a good person, as valuable and with good self-esteem. Pick environments where you can meet people that can help, not harm you. You can also be a good influence on other people.  7. Closure  When you finish the material for Session 12, discuss with the adolescent the following points:  1) Tell him/her that you’re finished with the material in the manual.  2) You can generate a brief discussion about how he/she felt with the manual and during the sessions.  3) You can also evaluate how the adolescent feels in terms of his/her depression. 4) Explain that during the last session you will be talking about how you’ve observed him/her in therapy and how he/she felt during the process. 5) Also explain that during the final session you will be offering recommendations about strategies to prevent relapses and to continue improving his/her mood.  6) Explain that after meeting with him/her you will meet with his/her parents to talk to them generally about his/her progress in therapy. Tell the adolescent that he/she can be present during the meeting if he/she chooses to do so.       CLOSING SESSION PARENTS AND ADOLESCENT   In this feedback and closing session, meet with the adolescent first and discuss the following points with him/her.   1. Offer the adolescent information about his/her participation and progress throughout therapy.  2. Ask him/her for feedback about his/her experience in therapy. You can ask about what the adolescent liked most and least, what helped the most, etc.  3. Make a plan to manage possible relapses and discuss strategies to prevent them.   4. Offer recommendations in terms of referral to other types of therapy or services if needed.  5. Offer an explanation about the meeting with his/her parents.

I am going to tell them about the main areas we’ve worked on in therapy and about your progress. I am going to tell them you’ve improved in _____________________; that you learned strategies such as ____________. If necessary, I’ll tell them there are still the following areas to work on _____ and that I have the following recommendations ________________________.  6. Establish an agenda with the adolescent for the meeting with the parents in which you discuss the following:  a. The specific information the therapist will share with the parents and the purpose of the meeting.  b. How you will keep confidential the things the adolescent has told you in therapy. You can tell the adolescent that you’re not going to go into specific details about what was said in therapy – you’re going to talk in general. c. Ask the adolescent if there is anything he/she doesn’t want you to discuss with his/her parents.       Next is the meeting with the parents  1.

It can make you feel less depressed, anxious and have a positive impact on your health.   Deep breathing is a way one can control the body’s reactions.  What do you feel in your body when you’re stressed out (afraid, nervous, angry)?  . Your heart beats master . Your muscles tense up . You breath faster  When you breathe in a calm and deep way, you’re sending your body a message that tells is that you’re relaxed, and little by little, you heart beat and breathing slows down, and your muscles relax.   Let’s do deep breathing exercise and later, a visualization or muscle relaxation exercise (or both). These exercises are optional. We recommend you try them out. If you don’t feel comfortable, simply close your eyes and listen.  Deep breathing exercise  Get in a comfortable position with your feet flat on the floor, without crossing your arms or legs. Close your eyes. When you breathe, try to fill out your abdomen and not just your chest. If you put a hand on your lower stomach and it goes up when you inhale you’re doing it right….Breathe deep and slow….Focus only on your breathing…nothing else….inhale slowly…and exhale…inhale slowly…and exhale…Assume a passive posture… don’t worry about how well you’re doing. When other thoughts come to mind, simply acknowledge them and come back to your breath…inhale slowly….and exhale…continue breathing naturally…               Relaxation Response (Robert Benson)   1. Pick a work, phrase or prayer that makes you feel peace, tranquil and calm. 2. Sit in a comfortable position in a place with no distractions.  3.  Close your eyes. 4. Relax your muscles, from your feet to your thighs, to your abdomen, shoulders, head and neck. Focus your attention on your muscles slowly releasing the tension from each one of them.  5. Breathe slowly and naturally. When you breathe, think about and repeat your word as you exhale.  6. Assume a passive posture or attitude. Don’t worry about how well you are doing. When other thoughts come to mind, simple acknowledge them and go back to your repetition.  7. Continue for 10 to 20 minutes.  8. Don’t stop immediately. Stay quietly seated for a minute letting other thoughts come to mind. Open your eyes and sit still for another minute before getting up.                                Progressive Muscle Relaxation  1. Breathe deeply 3 times, slowly exhaling after each breath. When you exhale imagine that the tension in your body is slowly beginning to disappear.  2. Close your hand into a fist. Hold it for 7 seconds; now let it go for 15 seconds... Feel the tension... Now let go of the fist and open your hand…Feel the tension disappear. Now your hand feels heavy… 3. Tense your forearm as if you were showing off your muscles in both arms. Hold it….and release. 4. Tense your triceps extending your arms in front of your body. Hold…and release…Feel the tension decrease and disappear.  5. Tense the muscles in your forehead by raising your eyebrows as much as you can…Hold….and release…Picture your muscles as becoming soft and relaxed… 6. Tense the muscles around your eyes by squeezing them shut…Hold… and relax…Feel a sense of deep relaxation spreading out all over that area…  7. Tense your jaw by opening your mouth real wide until you stretch those muscles…Hold…and release…Let your jaw drop... 8.

Tense your muscles in your knee…Hold…and release…Feel as your muscles are stretched and completely relaxed.  13. Tense the muscles in your legs slowly pointing your toes towards you…Hold …and release.  14. Now you’re going to do the opposite, pointing your toes in front of you…Hold…and release… 15. Imagine a wave of relaxation is slowly spreading throughout your body…starting at your head and gradually penetrating each group of muscles until it reaches your feet…eliminating any residual tension…          Imagery or Visualization Exercise (the beach)  *Start with a brief breathing and/or muscles relaxation exercise.  You’re walking on a beautiful beach…It’s almost deserted and expands across the horizon…You’re barefoot and you can feel the warm sand on your feet as you walk along the beach…You hear the sounds of the waves crashing on the shore…The sound is hypnotic, rhythmic…relaxing you more and more… The water is turquoise blue and the sand is white…You’re looking at the waves coming and going, crashing on the shore… Look at the sea’s surface on the horizon and follow it noticing how it curves as it touches the sky… At a distance you can see a sailboat as it slowly moves across the horizon… Everything you see helps you to let go and become more and more relaxed…As you continue walking on the sand, you can smell the fresh, salty scent of the ocean… Breathe deeply…inhale…and exhale…you feel more and more relaxed and refreshed… Looking at the sky you can see two seagulls that fly gracefully in the wind…Imagine what it would be like if you had the freedom to fly…You’re entering into a deep state of relaxation as you continue walking down the beach… Feel the fresh ocean breeze on your face and in your hair… The warmth of the sun on your neck and shoulders…It relaxes you more and more…and you’re staring to feel completely calm on this beautiful beach… In front of you, you see a lounge chair under a palm tree…Slowly you walk towards the chair, and when you reach it you sit down and relax into it… Lying in this position you relax more and more, entering a deeper state of relaxation and tranquility…Close your eyes and listen to the sound of the waves, coming and going. The rhythmic sound of the waves takes you into a deeper and deeper state of relaxation, of peace and calm…  Breathe deeply three more times… Now, in a minute, you can start to come back…Pay attention while I count from one to five…When I reach five you can open your eyes and sit up, alert and refreshed  One- gradually starting to come back Two – you’re becoming more and more awake Three – start to move your hands and legs a little while you awaken Four – you’re almost completely alert Five – open your eyes, you’re alert and refreshed         Appendix C  Projection into the future (Suggested example)   How do you see yourself in_________? .
